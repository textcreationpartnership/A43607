            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have peruſed the greateſt part of this <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> and find that the Learned and Reverend Author hath ſo mingled <hi>Utile &amp; Dulce</hi> together, that it cannot but in many reſpects miniſter much benefit and delight to the Readers of it. The <hi>Variety</hi> of the Matters, the <hi>Brevity</hi> of each Particular, the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of Doctrine, the <hi>Delicacy</hi> of Choiſe and Curious Notions, the many accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Collections out of learned Writers, Philoſophical, Hiſtorical, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical, are ſuch, as rendred it to me like a large <hi>Botanick garden,</hi> wherein there are Fruits for the Palate, Simples for the Health, Flowers for the Eye, Rarities for the Curious, Walks for Recreation, Arbors for Refreſhment; ſomething or other to pleaſe and entertain every comer. Or like a <hi>Jewel</hi> made up of many Diamonds, where each little ſtone contributeth to the beauty and ſparkling of the whole. There is ſcarce any ſubject of Divinity or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, concerning which we may not here find ſome elegant <hi>Strictures.</hi> The whole compoſure of the Work being not intended for a large, full and cloſe Tractation of the Subjects therein contained, but for a <hi>Collection</hi> of ſundry wholſom and delightful Obſervations, gathered together like Pearls in a Bracelet, or Suckets in a Banquet, to adorn the Argument, and delight the Reader. I ſhall ſay of it, what the Scripture ſaith of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that it is full of <hi>Milk and Honey,</hi> and hath in it many <hi>Beds of Spices,</hi> which with their fragrancy and ſweetneſs cannot but refreſh and recreate the minds of the Readers. So variouſly hath the Lord diſtributed his Gifts for the ſervice of his <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> that ſome bring Wood and Skins, ſome Sîlver and Gold, ſome Blue and Purple, ſome Scarlet and fine Linnen, ſome Onyx and Precious ſtones; ſome of which Materials are <hi>compacted</hi> into one Body and Frame, others ſerve for <hi>Embroidery</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> All for the ſanctity and glory of the whole. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> divideth the ſpoils of Men, as <hi>David</hi> did thoſe of the Nations, and conſecrateth them to the uſes of his Temple; making one mans <hi>Judgment</hi> and Reaſon, anothers <hi>Wit</hi> and Fancy, anothers <hi>Memory</hi> and Reading, anothers <hi>Oratory</hi> and Eloquence to be variouſly uſeful to the Edification of his Church, and Glory of his Name. Whereunto let all of us endeavour ſincerely to conſecrate both our ſelves and all that meaſure of Talents and enjoyments wherewith the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted us.</p>

                     <p>It differeth from all other ſciences: for although they be buſied about man; as phyſick, for the health of his body; Ethicks, for his civil converſation, &amp;c. Yet none of them leads him to the conſideration of his Maker.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Divinity paſſeth for the moſt part from the material and formal cauſe, and thinketh upon the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and final, the firſt and the laſt cauſe: And ſo while other ſciences are either plunged in the baſeneſs of the matter, or curiouſly ſearch into the forms of things (which can hardly be known) the Divine is carried back to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the firſt cauſe, to eternity, and to the laſt cauſe in eternity, which are the only comfortable meditations.</p>
                     <p>Divinity, is the book of Gods Word, Philoſophy the book of Gods Works. For Natural Theology is that knowledge, or rudiment of knowledge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, which may be obtained by the contemplation of his Creatures, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52564:2"/>knowledge may be termed truly Divine, in reſpect of the object; and natural, in reſpect of the light. The bounds of this knowledge are, that it ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eth to convince Atheiſm, but not to inform Religion. Hence there was never mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wrought to convince an Atheiſt, becauſe the light of nature might have led him to confeſs a God; But the Idolaters and Superſtitious had need of miracles, becauſe no light of nature extendeth to declare the Will and true Worſhip of God. Gods works ſhew his wiſdom and power, not his image; and therefore never honoured with the title of Gods image, but only the work of his hands.</p>
                     <p>The contemplations of man, do either penetrate to God, or are circumfer'd to nature, or are reflected or reverted upon himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Out of which ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries there do ariſe three knowledges. 1. Divine Philoſophy. 2. Natural Philoſophy. 3. And Humane Philoſophy, or Humanity: for all things are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſtamped with this triple character. 1. The power of God. 2. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of nature. 3. And the uſe of man.</p>
                     <p>Now out of the contemplation of nature, or ground of humane knowledge, to induce any verity or perſwaſion concerning the points of faith, is not ſafe; <hi>Da fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei quae fidei ſunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>It is moſt apparent that <hi>Aristotle</hi> (though ſtiled Natures chief Secretary, and (by thoſe Divines who ſet forth a Book concerning his Salvation) Chriſts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner in Naturals,

And I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear (for what have I to do to judge?) that is too true which a cleer head hath ſaid concerning him and others of his Tribe,
<note place="margin">Quantò doctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, tantò ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiores.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> The wiſer they were, the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they were; and the further from God and his Kingdom: their learning hung in their light,

                           <hi>Eth.</hi> l. 7. c. 3, 4.</note> and ſerved but to light them into utter darkneſs. Yea, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the diſability of moral knowledge to rectifie the intemperance of nature; which he alſo confirmed in his own practice.</p>
                     <p>I gueſs this to be one reaſon, why <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That the Philoſophers were the Patriarchs of the Hereticks. Not but that there is an excellent and neceſſary uſe of Philoſophy, which is a gift of God, and a great help to Divinity (called by ſome her Hand-maid.) But captious ſubtilties and Sophiſmes, or the meaſuring of Heavenly myſteries by natural reaſon; theſe are to be avoided, as vain deceits, idle ſpeculations, and aëry nothings.</p>
                     <p>Hence the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21, 22, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>They became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned. Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools: And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> into an image made like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beaſts, and creeping things. For the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.8.</note> for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are spiritually diſcerned: Therefore beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is concluded then, that to ſeek Divinity in Philoſophy, is to ſeek the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead: even as to ſeek Philoſophy amongſt Divinity, is to ſeek the dead amongſt the living.</p>
                     <p>For certainly it is not a natural knowledge, either by the notions imprinted in mans mind, whereby the conſcience is convinced; or by the conſideration of the creatures, that is ſufficient unto ſalvation, (though enough to leave us without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe:) But it muſt be the revealed knowledge, that which is attained by the Word of God; wherein God (though he dwell in the light, which none can attain unto, yet) hath revealed himſelf, ſo far as he ſaw ſit ſon us to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall therefore make the written Word of God, the man of our counſel in this preſent undertaking. And ſeeing the Globe of Divinity parts it ſelf into two hemiſpheres;

                        <p>God is only unchangeable, by Reaſon his Eſſence is every way infinite, and can no way move or change, but is what he is, alwayes the ſame.</p>
                        <p>If he were any way changed, it were for better or worſe; but not to be worſe; for then he ſhould paſs from perfect to imperfect, and ceaſe to be God; nor to be better, for then formerly he was leſs perfect, and ſo not God.</p>
                        <p>Men are mutable, and there's little hold to be taken of what they ſay; of many it may be ſaid, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> of the Peacock, <hi>All in changeable Colours:</hi> As <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Italy, Novitate quâdam nihil habet ſtabile;</hi> there's no taking their words.</p>
                        <p>But God, and all that is in God, is unchangeable; for this is an Attribute, that like a ſilken ſtring through a Chain of Pearl, runneth through all the reſt; his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is unchangeable, it endureth for ever; ſo his counſel, <hi>mutat ſententiam, ſed non decretum;</hi> he may change his ſentence, the outward threatning or promiſe,

                        <p>And whereas God is ſaid to repent, it is after another manner than man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Repentance with man, is the changing of his Will: Repentance with God,

What he hath written, he hath written (as <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid peremptorily) there's no removing of him.</p>
                        <p>So his love is immutable, his heart is the ſame to us in the diverſity of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conditions; we are changed in eſtate and opinion, but God he is not changed.</p>

                           <hi>That in very faithfulneſs God afflicted him,</hi> that he might be true to his ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may plainly perceive, the more mutable we are, the leſs we are like God. God is immutably holy, but we have an heart that loves to wander: He is alwayes the ſame, but we are ſoon removed, ſoon ſhaken in mind, whirried about with every blaſt, blown down with every temptation; which ſhould make us loath our ſelves, for our own fickle purpoſes, and changeable reſolutions: But the more we do continue in the good we have learned, and been aſſured of; the more we do reſemble the divine perfection.</p>
                        <p>Let us go to him alſo, to eſtabliſh and ſettle our ſpirits; God, that is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in himſelf, can bring us into an immutable eſtate of grace, againſt which all the gates of Hell cannot prevail; There be not quiet, till you have gotten ſuch gifts from him as are without Repentance, the fruits of Eternal grace, and the pledges of Eternal glory.</p>
                        <p>And carry we our ſelves to him, as unto an immutable good; in the greateſt change of things ſee him alwayes the ſame; when there is little in the Creature, there is as much in God as ever.</p>
                        <p>Yea, and let us grow up in the Image of God here, and get good evidences from Heaven, where we ſhall by God be made immutable too (though by grace only, and dependency of gift) and have the Image of God perfectly reſtored unto us, and be unchangeable in body and ſoul.</p>
                        <p>And let us haſten our ſelves hence in holy deſires, being in the midſt of ſo many changes in this life, wherein we are ſubject to ſo many alterations.</p>

                        <p>Goodneſs referred to God, is that property in God, whereby he is in himſelf moſt good, and communicateth his good things to others.</p>
                        <p>God and wicked men, are like unto true and counterfeit money; the one ſeem to be good, but are not; the other both ſeems, and is good. <hi>Phocian</hi> was ſirnam'd <hi>Bonus,</hi> but what was his goodneſs more than a ſilver ſin.</p>
                        <p>God is good Originally, others are good by participation only.</p>

                        <p> 
                           <hi>There is none good but one,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.17. Pſal. 119.68. Pſal. 34.8. Rom. 11.22.</note> that is God. Thou art good, and doeſt good. O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here let it be noted, that both <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> are attributed to God; yet there are not two things (much leſs two oppoſite things) in God, who is a ſimple Eſſence. They are the ſame in God oppoſed not formally, but in regard of the effect; as is the ſame heat of the Sun, which hardens the clay, and ſoftens the wax.</p>
                        <p>God hath revealed himſelf to be both merciful and juſt: Separate not theſe things which God hath joyned, but joyntly conſider of them, and it will help againſt two dangerous temptations, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Deſpair; and, 2. Preſumption; which are the two Arms of the Devil, whereby he gathers up ſouls for himſelf.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sinners deſpair, becauſe they cannot be perſwaded of mercy, only viewing the ſeverity of God, and poring upon that: Alas! I have offended God, and am afflicted in conſcience, I have deſerv'd to be a fire-brand of Hell; but yet conſider the ſweet goodneſs of God, he is juſt to damn ſtubborn ſinners, but to ſuch as humble themſelves, and with penitent hearts beg for mercy, he is a gracious God; witneſs <hi>Manaſſes, Magdalen, Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For the latter,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Satan will tell thee thou may'ſt take thy liberty, follow thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, needeſt not be ſo preciſe, for God is merciful: The remedy is to conſider, not only the mercy, but the ſeverity of God alſo; Remember how ſeverely he hath dealt with the Jews, for their Rebellion againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel; with <hi>David,</hi> for the matter of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> for ſtriking the Rock, when he ſhould only have ſpoken to it, &amp;c. For as the act of ſeeing is hindered, both by no light, and by too much; ſo the light and comfort of conſcience is hindered, either by not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mercy, or by ſeeing nothing elſe but mercy, which cauſeth preſumption.</p>
                        <p>Here is to be refuted the wicked opinion of the <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Marcionites,</hi> who held that there were two Beginnings, or (to ſpeak plainly) two Gods; one good, full of gentleneſs and mercy; the other, ſevere and cruel; this they made the Author of the Old Teſtament, and the other of the New.</p>
                        <p>But the anſwer is, 1. That Scripture maketh one and the ſame God, both boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and full of goodneſs, and the ſame alſo ſevere. 2. And though ſeverity and mercy ſeem to be contrary, yet, that is not in reſpect of the Subject; for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is not capable of contrary and repugnant qualities: But in regard of the contrary effects, which are produced in contrary Subjects. Like as the Magiſtrate is not contrary to himſelf, if he ſhew mercy unto thoſe that are willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and be ſevere in puniſhing obſtinate offenders. Or as the Sun by the ſame heat worketh contrary effects, in ſubjects of a diverſe and contrary diſpoſition and quality.</p>
                        <p>To conclude then, Who have goodneſs? and who have ſeverity? If thou repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and obeyeſt the Goſpel, thou art an happy man; the ſweetneſs of God and his goodneſs is to thee. But if thou beeſt a profane, unbelieving, impenitent wretch, and dyeſt in this eſtate; the moſt juſt God will in his great ſeverity caſt thee into Hell,

                        <p>When Jeſus was baptized, prayed, the Heavens were opened, and the Aire clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a new and glorious light; and the Holy Ghoſt in the manner of a Dove, alighted upon his Sacred Head; and God the Father gave a voice from Heaven, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> This was the greateſt meeting that ever was upon Earth, where the whole Cabinet of the myſterious Trinity was opened and ſhewn, as much as the capacities of our preſent imperfections will permit.

                     <p>As for Angels, they be neither God nor man: therefore they cannot be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours.

Nay, properly to ſpeak, the Holy Ghoſt, the third perſon in the glorious Trinity, cannot be our Mediatour: for though he be God, yet he is not man; much leſs can the Angels or Saints be our Mediatours.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Mediatour of the New Covenant, hath eſtabliſhed the Covenant with his blood. It is Chriſt alone, that by the blood of his croſs, hath ſet at peace all things in heaven and in earth. And no Teſtament is of force, without the death of the Teſtatour. Let them prove that any died for us beſides Chriſt, and then we will acknowledge other Mediatours. As he trode the Wine-preſs alone, ſo he is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour alone: It is Sacriledge to adjoyn others to him. Therefore as he took the pains alone, ſo let him have the honour alone.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Chriſt is Mediatour, not only of Redemption, (as the Papiſts grant) but of Interceſſion alſo, (of which in due place.) He being ſo near us in the matter of his Incarnation, will never be ſtrange to us in the buſineſs of Interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt then being the ſole Mediatour, Let us not cry with thoſe Idolaters, <hi>O Baal, hear us:</hi> But ask the Father in the Sons name, and ſay, <hi>O Chriſt, hear us.</hi> Who prevails more with the King, than the Kings Son?

                        <p>There was a worthy and glorious Prieſt-hood in time of the Law: there was an high-prieſt in goodly apparel, clothed with a white linnen Ephod, that had a Miter on his head, a fair breaſt-plate on his breaſt, on which was written the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> He went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> once a year, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up the prayers of the people. Beſides him there were a great number of Prieſts and Levites, throughout all the towns and Cities of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> they offered the ſacrifices of the people, and made attonement for them before the Lord: they taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and inſtructed them in the ways of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>Yet all theſe are nothing to our Saviour Chriſt: he excells them as much as the Sun doth the Starres, or the body the ſhadow. They were all but ſhadows of him, he is the true high-Prieſt. They were but men, he is God and man: they ſinful, he without ſin: they mortal, he immortal: their ſacrifices were but figures of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: the blood of Lambs, Goats offered by them took away no ſin; his blood purgeth us from all ſin: they received tithes of their brethren; but they themſelves paid tithes to Chriſt: they prayed for the people in the Temple; Chriſt prayes for us in heaven.</p>
                        <p>Wherein we may behold the ſupereminent dignity of Chriſt his Prieſt-hood. It cannot be denied, but that <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſt-hood was moſt glorious; As the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh of the Church, many glorious things are recorded of it. There was a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle, a ſumptuous Temple, the wonder of the world, there was an admirable Altar, many oblations and ſacrifices, there were ſundry Sabbaths and new Moons, divers feſtival days, the feaſt of unleavened bread, of the blowing of Trumpets, of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, of Dedication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which were kept with wonderful ſolemnity; there were many waſhings and purgings for the clenſing of the people.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let us magnifie God for this our high-prieſt, by whom we have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Kingdom of heaven. The high Prieſt went into the Holy of Holies himſelf, but he carried none of the people with him, they ſtood without: Our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prieſt is not only gone into heaven himſelf, but he hath alſo brought us thither. That high-prieſt offered Bulls, Calves, Lambs for the ſins of the people; this high-prieſt offered himſelf for us all.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let us honour and reverence this our high-prieſt; yea, let us ſubject our ſelves to him in all things, which hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father, that we may reign with him for ever, and ever.</p>

                        <p>When the Judge of an Aſſizes gives the charge, all that be preſent, eſpecially they of the grand Inqueſt, conſider ſeriouſly what is ſpoken: Chriſt Jeſus the Judge of the whole world, gives a charge by his Miniſtery.

Thus the Covenant is made known in all the books of Scripture, before Chriſts coming; called <hi>the old Teſtament or Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.13.2 Cor. 3.14.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As performed, fulfilled and actually accompliſhed, in Chriſt already come and manifeſted in our fleſh, in fulneſs of time. And thus the Covenant is moſt clearly and fully unveiled to us, in all the Books of Scripture written ſince Chriſts coming; which are therefore ſtiled <hi>the new Covenant,</hi> or <hi>the new Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 8.8. Mat. 26.28. Heb. 9.15.</p>
                        <p>The new Teſtament is better than the old, not in regard of the ſubſtance, the ſubſtance of both is one, which is Chriſt Jeſus; but in reſpect of divers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: For, 1. The Old Teſtament did but ſhadow out things to come: the New Teſtament makes a gift and exhibition of them.
<note place="margin">Col. 2.17.</note> So that as the body is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſhadow; ſo is the New Teſtament than the Old. 2. That was dark and obſcure, this plain and perſpicuous. 3. This hath ſewer, more lively and eaſie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. 4. That was temporal, and therefore not ratified with an Oath; this is eternal, and laſteth for ever: for the which cauſe it was confirmed with an Oath. 5. The Mediatour or Surety of that was <hi>Moſes;</hi> the Surety of this is Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>In compariſon then with the ſtate of the Old Teſtament, how much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged are we to God, who live in the times of the New, in reſpect of the clear Revelation of Grace and Life untous? The Prophets of the Old Teſtament, they were as a <hi>ſound; John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſts immediate fore-runner, was a <hi>voyce,</hi> he is called ſo; but it is Chriſt, and he only who is the Word, diſtinctly and fully ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to us the Will of God concerning our ſalvation. God ſpake with <hi>Moſes</hi> at the door of the Tabernacle, but now he leadeth his Spouſe into the Preſence-Chamber: The Old Teſtament-Chriſtians ſaw through a veil, but now the Curtain is drawn; with them it was the dawning of the day, with us it is full Noon: Oh that we would praiſe the Lord for his ineſtimable goodneſs to us, upon whom the glorious light of the Goſpel ſhineth.</p>

Nor by faith; for that comes by relation and report of others. 4. Nor by Art; for that muſt be by defining, dividing, compounding, comparing, reaſoning, &amp;c. 5. Nor ſucceſſively; for God knows all things in one view, and not one after another. 6. But by his Eſſence, by a way more excellent above all Men and Angels; by a knowledge moſt true, certain, evident and perfect.</p>

                     <p>The creature is ſaid to be ſubject to vanity,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Trapp.</hi>
                        </note> and bondage of corruption: 1. As corruptible. 2. As teachers of men. 3. As they are inſtruments of mans puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. As they are forced to ſerve wicked mens turns and uſes, who have no peace with the creature, and ſhould have no ſervice from them.</p>
                     <p>The vanity of the creatures is not natural,
<note place="margin">Parr.</note> but accidental by ſin; which though it be expiate by the blood of Chriſt, yet the creature ſhall not be freed, till ſin be taken out of the nature of things. Sin hath involved the creature under the curſe, and makes it to groan: not the ſin of it, but of us.</p>
                     <p>The manner how the creature ſhall be reſtored, is difficult to determine. There are three opinions:</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt opinion holdeth, That this earth and viſible heaven, even the whole nature of theſe things, ſhall periſh. This heaven and earth being appointed by God to be the habitation of man, while he is <hi>Viator;</hi> and therefore that there ſhall be no need of it, when he ſhall be <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond opinion is, That ſome of the creatures ſhall be aboliſhed, and ſome reſtored: The heavens and the elements to remain, the reſt to periſh.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third opinion, That all creatures ſhall be reſtored, remembring that we ſpeak not of reaſonable creatures, nor of the Heaven of heavens.</p>
                     <p>The two firſt opinions ſeem unlikely; the third is moſt probable, if the reſtoring be only to ſome ſingulars of all kinds. But it is not ſafe walking in the dark, without a light. We know not how it ſhall be; but this we may be ſure of, that all things ſhall be moſt wiſely and excellently brought to paſs.</p>
                     <p>The loaſt and meaneſt of Gods creatures, ſerve to ſet forth the glory of him their Creator, and may be in their places ſome way or other uſeful to man.

                        <p>In the earth are worms houſed. A worm is one of the meaneſt creatures, and therefore to ſhew what a poor thing man is, he is twice in one place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a worm, <hi>Job</hi> 25.6. Thus Chriſt alſo beſpeaks himſelf, when he took our nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.</p>
                        <p>Man may be ſaid to be a worm in ſeveral reſpects; Look upon him, 1. In his original and conſtitution, he is from the earth, as the worm is. 2. In his natural ſtate and condition, he liveth upon the earth and earthly things, as worms do. 3. Becauſe ſubject to danger, every foot may cruſh him. 4. Becauſe unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or make defence; unleſs the Lord be his ſhield, and a defence to him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. 5. Becauſe he muſt ſhortly return into the earth, and when he comes to the grave, it will be worm to worm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mihi experto credite</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aug.</hi>) Believe me who have made trial of it: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a grave, and upon the dead mans head, you ſhall find toads leaping, begotten of his brains; upon his loins ſerpents crawling, begotten of his raynes; in his belly worms abounding, ariſing out of his entrails. Behold what we now are, and what we ſhortly ſhall be; Behold the Original and filthineſs of ſin.</p>
                        <p>The beſt are but worms-meat; the worms ſhall cover them, who haply were once covered with coſtlieſt cloathing.
<note place="margin">Mark 9.44.</note> But take heed of that <hi>Worm which never dieth;</hi> for as out of the corruption of our bodies worms breed, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the fleſh; ſo out of the corruption of our ſouls, this never-dying worm. This worm (ſay Divines) is a continual remorſe and furious reflection of the ſoul upon its own wilful folly, and now woful miſery.</p>
                        <p>Oh conſider this, before thy friends be ſcrambling for thy goods, worms for thy body, and Devils for thy ſoul. Go not Dancing to Hell in thy Bolts, rejoyce not in thy Bondage, as many do; to whom the preaching of Hell, is but as the painting of a toad, which men can look on and handle, without affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

The firſt a catachreſtical or farre derived ſimilitude it holds with man, that is, in a bifurcation or diviſion of the root into two parts; which ſome are content to call thighs: when as fair a reſemblance is often found in others.

The laſt, that there follows an hazard of life, to them that pull it up, or they live not very long after, or that ſome evil ſate purſues them: A conceit not only injurious to truth (being confutable by daily experience) but ſomewhat derogatory to the providence of God.

To prevent charming or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, he faſt ſtops his ear; of which <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus, <hi>Quum caeperet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantatorem ſuum pati, allidit unam aurem terrae, &amp; caudâ obturat alteram.</hi> That the Serpent when ſhe beginneth to feel the Charmer, clappeth one of her ears cloſe to the ground, and ſtoppeth the other with her tail. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe, and the like is affirmed by <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Caſſiadore.</hi> So ought Chriſtians to beware of the worlds allurements, and Satans incantations; but to hearken to the wiſe charmings of the Goſpel. 3. Swimming over a river, he ſtrives to hold up his head; ſo ought Chriſtians to take heed they be not drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world. 4. He ſhuns the ſociety of man, as his deadly enemy,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6 9.</note> and chuſeth rather to inhabit the Wilderneſs, and even to haunt briars and brambles for his defence. So ought the godly, rather to ſeek peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſolitary retiredneſs, than to be amongſt their profeſt enemies; yea, <hi>chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25.</note> than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> 5. The Serpent is vigilant, ſleeps little, but leſs when he ſuſpects danger. So ought Chriſtians, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. 6. They once a year caſt their coat, and renew themſelves. So ought Chriſtians, to labour to be rid of old corruptions, and to get new ſanctified ſouls, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. for, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo ſix properties in a Serpent to be ſhunned; 1. He hath a very lofty ſpirit, reaching not only at men, but birds. But let Chriſtians take heed of pride and ambition. 2. They embrace while they ſting, lying in the green graſs, and ſweet flowers, to deſtroy the paſſenger. But let Chriſtians avoid flattery, which tickles a man to death. 3. The Serpent is unthankful, he will kill him that nouriſheth him. But let not Chriſtians be guilty of that hateful ſin
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52564:27"/>of ingratitude, which renders a man the Prodigie of nature. 4. They are marvellous voracious, killing more than they can eat. But let Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they turn not covetous engroſſers. <hi>Wo unto them that joyn houſe to houſe, that lay field to field,
<note place="margin">Iſa 5.8.</note> till there bo no place, that they may be placed alone in the midſt of the carth.</hi> 5. Their hoſtility and murtherous mind, they would kill all, to ſet up their own kind. Such is the depopulator, that thinks he hath not room enough, unleſs he could be rid of the Poor, and make them harbourleſs. But let Chriſtians avoid this, as they would the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned woe. 6. Their enmity to man, whom they ought to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. (<hi>Malice</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſostom) turneth men into ſerpents.)</hi> The like are the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> that deny allegiance to Kings, &amp;c.

                        <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> of man is a moſt honourable member, called <hi>his glory,</hi> becauſe it is the inſtrument to glorifie God.</p>
                        <p>Before the fall the Tongue of man was like a ſwift writer, and uttered thoſe things which his heart indited, and he ſpake but with one tongue: But ſince the fall it is a world of iniquity, and he is <hi>bilinguis,</hi> double tongu'd, yea <hi>trilinguis;</hi> for a backbiter is a man with a threefold tongue, or a tongue which hath three ſtings: We have an example of it in <hi>Doeg,</hi> who killed three at once with his evil report; <hi>Saul,</hi> the Prieſts, and himſelf.</p>
                        <p>There are but five vertues of the tongue reckoned by Philoſophers, but there are many ſins of the tongue, ſome have reckoned up as many as there be letters in the Alphabet. Moreover it is obſervable that when the Apoſtle gives us the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of wickedneſſe in all the members of the body, he ſtayeth longeſt on the Organs of ſpeech, and goeth over them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13, 14. And Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpends almoſt a whole Chapter upon it. <hi>Cap</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> is made in the ſhape of a ſword, and <hi>David</hi> felt it as a ſword in his bones; it is ſharp as a Raſor, which inſtead of ſhaving the hair, cutteth the throat. It is of a flame colour, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature.</p>
                        <p>Maſter <hi>Trapp</hi> recites a ſtory out of <hi>Camerarius,</hi> concerning two brethren walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in a ſtar-light night: Saith one of the brethren, would I had a paſture as larg: as this element; And ſaith the other, would I had as many Oxen as there be Stars, Saith the other again, where would you feed thoſe Oxen? in your paſture, replied he. What? whether I would or no? yea ſaid he, whether you would or no, What? in ſpite of me? yes, ſaid he. And thus it went on from words, till at length each ſheathed his ſword in anothers bowels. <hi>Behold how great a matter a little kindleth. And the tongue is a fire.</hi>

                        <p>There is much need you ſee of reforming and poliſhing this member. Death and life (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) are in the power of the tongue: Upon the right or ill uſing of it, a mans ſafety doth depend. And leſt you ſhould think the Scripture only inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth temporal ſafety or ruine: Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and by thy words condemned.</hi> One of the prime things that ſhalt be brought forth to judgment, are your words. Again, <hi>He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips ſhall have deſtruction.</hi> The wiſe man intimateth a ſimilitude of a City beſieged, to open the gates betrayeth the ſafety of it; all watch and ward is about the gate: So the tongue is the gate or door of the Soul, by which it goeth out in converſe and communication; to keep it open and looſe guarded, letteth in an enemy, which proveth the death of the Soul.</p>

                        <p>And wiſely hath he placed them. There are ſome members that are called <hi>membra ridicalia,</hi> radical members; as the Liver, the Heart, and the Brain; And in theſe the Lord hath placed the natural, vital and animal ſpirits, Theſe ſpirits are carried by the veins, arteries and nerves; The veins carry the vital ſpirits from the Liver; the arteries carry the natural ſpirits from the heart; and the nerves carry the animal ſpirits from the brain.

Moreover, one member defends another, as when the head is in danger, the hand caſts it ſelf up to ſave it.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, the members of the body help one another, the ſuperior rule the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerior; as the eyes the whole body: The inferior uphold and ſupport the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; as the feet the leggs; the thighs ſupport the who'e body: And the middle members defend the body, and provide things neceſſary for it; as we ſee in the hands and arms.

                           </gap>, in Latine <hi>Conſcientia;</hi> a joint knowledge, or a knowledge with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: Either <hi>cum alio,</hi> that is, with the High and Eternal God; for none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God and a mans own ſelf, hath an immediate knowledge of himſelf: Or rather <hi>ſcientia cum alia ſcientia;</hi> there is a knowledge whereby we know that we know, and that is Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Damaſcen</hi> defines it thus; It is <hi>lex noſtri intellectus.</hi> And certainly, <hi>Conſcientia non eſt contra ſcientiam, ſed cum ſcientia;</hi> elſe it is a Chimera of mans own. Origen, <hi>Eſt correptor &amp; paedagogus animae.</hi> Bernard, <hi>Eſt inſeparabilis gloria vel confuſio uniuſcujuſque.</hi> The Schoolmen ſay.

                        </p>
                        <p>I conceive, it may be thus defined. <hi>Conſcience is a function of the underſtanding, whereby we apply the general knowledge that is in us, to our particular thoughts, words and actions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For it is not a part of the Will, but of the Underſtanding: not of that which we call the <hi>orical,</hi> but of that which is termed <hi>practical.</hi> For as a dead man is no man, but <gap reason="foreign">

Whereupon the Schoolmen contend, that it is neither <hi>habitus,</hi> nor <hi>potentia,</hi> but <hi>actus:</hi> His whole work being to apply the general Knowledge engraven in us by the pen of Nature, to our particular thoughts, words and actions.</p>

                        <p>Well ſpake a learned Divine: We indeed pray to God, <hi>Our Father in heaven;</hi> Heaven is the throne of God, but Heaven is not the priſon of God; Gods glory ſhines moſt in Heaven, but God is never ſhut up in Heaven. Therefore he that is every where,
<note place="margin">Deut non minor eſt in minimis, quàm in maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</note> can as well do all, as any one thing. Hence God acts in every thing that acts; and there is not any motion in the creature, but God is in it. They who act againſt the revealed will of God, are yet ordered by his ſecret will. There is nothing done againſt the counſel and purpoſe of God, though many things are done againſt the command and appointment of God.</p>

                        <p>Sin is like thoſe <hi>Lamiae,</hi> certain ſhapes of Devils, which taking on them the ſhew of beautiful women, devoured children and young men, allured unto them with ſweet enticements.</p>

                        <p>Though the Lord ſpeak not inſtantly to every ſinner as he did to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20.3. <hi>Behold thou art but a dead man:</hi> yet 'tis true of every ſin,

                        <p>When men will not hear, then there is no remedy but they muſt feel. For when God laies ſiege to the ſoul, he hath both warning-pieces and murdering-pieces; if the one will not reclaim ſinners, the other ſhall ruine them. The ſinner therefore is blinder than <hi>Balaam,</hi> that walks on in an evil courſe, and ſees not the ſword of Gods vengeance before him</p>
                        <p>I have read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that a Lady had a room hanged with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arras, behind which were placed certain Croſs-bows ready bent and charged, and in the midſt of the room there was a goodly brazen image, reſembling the King, holding in the one hand a fair golden Apple, ſet richly with <hi>Smaragds, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, Saphiers, Topazes, Rubies, Turkaſſes,</hi> and ſuch like precious ſtones; which the King viewing, demanded whom the image did repreſent? to whom ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, him; and ſaid, ſhe provided it as a gift for him, and therefore deſired him to accept it, though not worthy ſo high a dignity; wherein the King delighting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Apple, the better to adviſe it: whereupon the Croſs-bows diſcharged ſo directly upon him, that ſtriking him through in ſundry places, he fell down ſtark dead, and lay flat on the ground. Even ſo the poor ſinner is not aware,
<note place="margin">Prov. 7.23.</note> till a Dart ſtrike through his liver.</p>
                        <p>It is ſtoried, that in the inmoſt part of <hi>Affrick,</hi> are certain wild beaſts having the countenance of a woman, which in like manner are called <hi>Lamiae,</hi> as before; And my Author ſaith, that they have their paps and all the reſt of their breaſt ſo fair, as any Painters wits can deviſe; by which being uncovered, they deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allure men unto them, and when they have taken them, they do forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them. So doth ſin, making a man cry out at laſt, wo is me now,
<note place="margin">Jer. 4 31.</note> for my ſoul is wearied becauſe of murderers.</p>
                        <p>It is beſt of all therefore not to ſin, and next to that, to amend upon puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                           <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of a fountain near <hi>Monacris</hi> in <hi>Arcadia,</hi>

                        <p>The Poets have feigned a river to be in hell, called by the ſame name;

                        <p>God proportions the puniſhment of man with his ſin; and that two manner of wayes, 1. In the quality and manner of it. 2. In the quantity or degree of it. The juſtice of God is viſible in both. <hi>Adonibezek</hi> was (and ſo have many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers been) puniſhed in the ſame manner that he had ſinned. But all ſhall

                        <p>But yet the Puniſhment of ſin may come long after the comitting of ſin. The one is a ſeed-time, the other a reaping-time, betwixt which there is a diſtance of time.

                        <p>The Ceremonial law did obſcruely and imperfectly repreſent Chriſt to the old Church, and is now aboliſhed by his coming in the fleſh. In the twelveth year of our Saviours age, (the ſame year wherein he taught in the Temple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.) the Sanctuary was polluted, by caſting about the bones of dead men, thorow every part and Porch thereof, at the very feaſt of the Paſſeover, in the night time. This <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaith, was done by the Samaritanes, out of hatred to the Jewiſh ſervices: But God had ſurely a ſpecial hand in it, to ſhew that people, that thoſe ſhadows were to vaniſh, now that Chriſt the body was come and ſhewed himſelf.</p>
                        <p>All things have their time, the Ceremonial law had her time; and the Goſpel hath his time. We our ſelves have but our time, ſome threeſcore years and ten, and then we are gone.</p>

                     <p>The Law was before the Goſpel, yet the Goſpel is more worthy than it: dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs went before the light; the night before the day: yet the day is more glorious than the night. All creatures were made before man, yet man excelleth them all. The Sword-bearer goes before the Major, yet he is not greater than the Major. All things are not to be eſteemed by their precedency and priority in the world: <hi>There cometh one after me</hi> (ſaid <hi>John</hi>) <hi>yet in honour and dignity he is before me.</hi> So the Goſpel cometh after the Law, yet it is more excellent than the Law.</p>
                     <p>In the Law there is nothing but matter of fear, in the Goſpel of love; in the Law God is againſt us, in the Goſpel he is <hi>Emanuel, God with us.</hi> The Law cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the Goſpel bleſſeth; The Law is a denunciation of wrath, of a curſe againſt us, becauſe of tranſgreſſion; only the Goſpel is an annunciation of mercy and forgiveneſs: That breatheth forth only a cold blaſt, a North-wind of threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this ſendeth forth a warm gale, a South-wind of Promiſe. The office of the Law is to accuſe and terrifie, of the Goſpel to heal and comfort: Finally, the Law is a killing Letter, but the Goſpel a quickning Spirit.</p>

Indeed, thoſe doctrines which reveal God and Chriſt, can only give ſolid comfort unto the ſoul; and theſe doctrines are no where made known but in holy Writ; and they are moſt clearly delivered in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel holds forth the New Covenant, (that conſtellation of Promiſes;) ſo called, not ſimply, but in reſpect of the diſcovery of it; as we call ſome places the New world. Unto this Covenant, the Sacraments are the Broad-ſeal, and the Spirit is the Privy-ſeal. This Covenant was a great chearer to <hi>Davids</hi> heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure: Which is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo Chriſts Teſtament and laſt Will: And this is the comfort of Gods elect, that Heaven is conveyed unto them by legacy: All that God requires of us, is, to take hold of his Covenant, and to receive his gift of righteouſneſs; And this alſo he hath promiſed to cauſe us to do, writing his law in our hearts, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And truly, the Goſpel is chiefly promiſſory; yea, it is a Promiſe, and that ſuch as hath many Promiſes in the womb of it; and thoſe (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) exceeding great and precious; not of temporals, but ſpirituals, nay, eternals. Fellowſhip with God, remiſſion, adoption, eternal life; what not? are the choiſe and precious benefits which the Goſpel revealeth and offereth to us. So that it is a treaſury of divine riches, a ſtorehouſe of the ſouls proviſion, a Cabinet of heavenly pearls; all things truly good, and juſtly deſireable, being contained in, and conveyed to us by it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the preaching of the Goſpel is the bell whereby we are called to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory. As by the ſound of a trumpet the people were called together in the time of the Law; ſo this is the Silver-trumpet ſounding in our ears, whereby we are called to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The common opinion is (and the moſt antient Copies ſay as much) that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> wrote his Goſpel eight years after Chriſt; <hi>Mark,</hi> ten; <hi>Luke,</hi> fifteen; and <hi>John,</hi> forty two.</p>

                     <p>The Turks uſe to ſay, what is by God written in a mans forehead before his birth, cannot in his life be a voided. But let none be ſo ſottiſh and blaſphemous, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52564:46"/>to ſay, If I be predeſtinated to be ſaved, then I may live as I liſt; for howſoever I live, I muſt he ſaved: And if I be predeſtinated to be damned, all my care cannot alter the counſel of God; And therefore our beſt way is to take our pleaſure while we may.</p>
                     <p>From whence haſt thou this collection? not from God and his Word, but from the Devil and thine own ignorance. For, put the caſe (as a Divine ſaith well) thou wert on the top of an high Tower; God hath predeſtinated, that thou ſhalt come ſafely down, or break thy neck in coming down: wilt thou now leap down upon this reaſon, neglecting the ordinary way? I trow thou wilt not truſt thy body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe termes; then art thou mad ſo to truſt thy ſoul. God hath predeſtinated thou ſhalt live to the end of this preſent day, or that thou ſhalt die before night, wilt thou upon this drink poyſon, &amp;c. Saying, why? If God have predeſtinated that I ſhall live, I ſhall live though I eat poyſon: If to die, I ſhall die, though I be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo careful? If thou beeſt in thy right mind, thou wilt not do thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had the aſſurance of prolonging his life fifteen years, yet neglected not the means of preſerving his life. So the Predeſtination of God, ought not to make us careleſſe of the means of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Origen</hi> maketh mention of one who being ſick, and deſiring to ſend to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, was perſwaded by his friend not to ſend; for, ſaith he, If it be appointed you ſhall die, the Phyſician cannot help you: if to live, you ſhall not need him. The ſick man of a ſounder brain than his friend, excellently anſwered: Nay, if it be appointed I ſhall live, I will ſend for the Phyſician, that ſuch appointment may take effect.</p>
                     <p>Thus God hath predeſtinated me to be ſaved; So hath he predeſtinated me to be called and juſtified, before I be ſaved. Though glorification neceſſarily follow Predeſtination, yet not immediately, but there are means from one to another, which God hath predeſtinated to be uſed. As thou art predeſtinated to glory, ſo alſo by the ſame act to holineſſe, without which he hath predeſtinated to ſave none.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore concluded, that this opinion then is moſt abſurd in reaſon; and alſo moſt blaſphemous. And this for certain, that whoſoever thinketh, reaſoneth, and liveth thus; In that time he can have no aſſurance that he ſhall be ſaved: And if he continue thus to the end, there can be no greater ſign of a mans reprobation and damnation.</p>

<note place="margin">Hebr. 8.7.</note> was not Chriſt promiſed to them in the time of the law, as well as to us in the time of the Goſpel? Did not God ſay to <hi>Adam, The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head?</hi> To <hi>Abraham, in thy ſeed ſhall all Nations be bleſſed?</hi> How then are our Promiſes better than theirs, when as Chriſt and the Kingdome of heaven were promiſed to them as well as to us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the promiſes there are thoſe two things conſiderable, 1. The <hi>matter.</hi> 2. And the <hi>manner.</hi> As for matter and ſubſtance, the Promiſes were all one, both in the Old and New-Teſtament; that is, Chriſt and eternal ſalvation by him, But ours in reſpect of the manner, are better and do excel theirs. For, 1. Their Promiſes were included within the narrow compaſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> our promiſes are blazed all the world over. 2. Their promiſes were publiſhed by men, by the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which were but ſervants; ours by Chriſt the Son of God. 3. They according to the promiſe had the graces of Gods ſpirit as well as we have, yet not in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant meaſure, as they be now poured out in the time of the Goſpel. 4. Their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were dark and obſcure, covered under the vail of many Ceremonies, and ſhadowed out by temporal things: Ours are more cleare and evident. 5. Theirs were at the delivery of the Law, with a condition, <hi>Do this, and live; Curſed be he that continueth not in all things, &amp;c.</hi> Ours, <hi>beleeve, and live.</hi> 6. The Sacraments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Promiſes were confirmed unto them, were more hard and difficult: the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the fore-skin, the preparing of a Lamb for every houſe: Ours are more eaſy and familiar: the ſprinkling of a little water, the procuring of bread and wine. 7. Their promiſes were of things to come, there ſhould come a Lamb, that ſhould take away the ſins of the world: Ours are of things already come and exhibited. This Lamb is come, and hath offered up himſelf on the Altar of the Croſſe for us.</p>
                        <p>Thus hath God in mercy vouchſafed us better promiſes; ſurely he looks for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obedience at our hand. <hi>To whom much is given, much is required.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>See at once both the goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God; his goodneſs, in that before he gave his Son, he gave the Promiſe of him; he was <hi>Promiſſus priuſquam miſſus;</hi> firſt, aſſured verbally, then ſent actually; and his faithfulneſſe, in that as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo he gave him; <hi>Sicut promiſſus ſic miſſus,</hi> he was not more mercifully promiſed, than faithfully ſent.

                        <p>Our recreation or redemption, is a greater might and mercy than all the reſt; for in the creation God made man like himſelf, but in the redemption he made himſelfe like man:

Alſo it is a greater work to bring men from ſin to grace, than being in the ſtate of grace, to bring them to glory; becauſe ſin is far more diſtant from grace, than grace is from glory.</p>
                        <p>By Chriſt we have a plenary redemption of ſoul and body, out of the clawes of Satan. As the bird is in the fowlers net, ſo were we in the Devils ſnare: but we may ſay with them in the <hi>Pſalme, the net is broken, and we are delivered;</hi> yea, we are delivered eternally, we ſhall never fall into that bondage again. The afflictions whereunto we are incident in this life, <hi>viz.</hi> Sickneſs, poverty, malevolent tongues, impriſonment, death it ſelf, &amp;c. are temporal; but our redemption and joy are eternal. Let that comfort us, in all the calamities of this life.</p>
                        <p>We love them that obtain a temporal redemption for us. If a young man be bound prentiſe to an hard Maſter, for fourteen or twelve yeares, and if one ſhould buy out his Apprentiſhip and ſet him free; would he not take himſelf much beholden to him? If thou wert a Gall-yſlave under the Turk, and one ſhould rid thee out of it, wert thou not much beholden to him? We were bound Prentiſes to Sathan, he kept us in his ſnare at his will and pleaſure: being his bondmen, we ſhould have remained in hell-fire world without end. Now Chriſt Jeſus hath redeemed us, and made us the free-men of God, and Citizens of heaven; how are we indebted to him? Chriſt hath brought us out of the Gally of ſin and damnation; therefore let us ſound forth his praiſes all the dayes of our life.</p>
                        <p>In the work of redemption God layes naked to us the tendreſt bowels of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly compaſſion. For by giving us his Son, he ſhewed us all his love at once, as it were imbodyed. All other ſpiritual bleſſings meet in this, as the lines in the center, as the ſtreames in the fountaine.</p>

                        <p> If the Centurion were held worthy of reſpect, becauſe <hi>he loved our Nation</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>and built us a Synagogue:</hi> What ſhall we ſay of Almighty God, who ſo loved our ſoules, <hi>that he gave his onely begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The end of our redemption is to ſerve God, we are redeemed from our old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, not to our old converſation: we are bought with the blood of Chriſt, not to ſerve the Devil, our ſelves, the fleſh, the world: we have ſerved them too much already: from henceforth we muſt ſerve God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt hath therefore broke the devils yoke (ſaith one) from off our necks,

                        <p>It is the eſtate and condition of Chriſtianity. For herein we are called to the ſervice of God, in all parts of holineſs, with promiſe of eternal reward through the merits of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>So it is termed, becauſe the means by which God worketh upon us, ordinarily is his Word, or the voice of his ſervants, calling upon us for amendment. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52564:49"/>becauſe through the mighty working of the Spirit of Chriſt, the voice of Gods ſervants ſpeaking out of the Word, is directed unto us in particular with ſuch power and life, and our dead hearts are ſo revived, that the doctrine is, as if God did ſpeak to us in particular, we receiving the word of the Miniſter, as the very voice or word of Chriſt: Thus <hi>the dead hear the voice of the Son of God, and live.</hi> As alſo, becauſe God would hereby note unto us the eaſineſs of the work, he can do it with a word: As he made the world, and <hi>calleth up the generations of men,</hi> as the Prophet ſheaketh, ſo can he in an inſtant with a word convert a ſinner, He ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> So if he ſay, Let there be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>There is a twofold calling: 1. External, that general invitation, which by the preaching of the Goſpel is made unto men, to invite them to come in unto Jeſus Chriſt: moſt in the world are thus called, both good and bad. 2. Internal, when the Spirit of God accompanies the outward adminiſtration of the Word, to call a man from ignorance to knowledge; and from a ſtate of nature, to a ſtate of grace. So that the firſt is alone by the outward ſound of the Word; But the other, not by the trumpet of the Word alone ringing in the ear; but by the voice of the Spirit alſo, perſwading the heart, and moving us to go to Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>If we be thus called, we ſhall receive the eternal inheritance, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us.

                        <p>There are two parts in this work of grace: 1. The one is, <hi>Qua regeneramur,</hi> by which we are begotten. 2. The other is, <hi>Qua renaſcimur,</hi> by which we are born again. The one is Gods act purely; the other implieth the manifeſtation of life in our ſelves. A diſtinction that ſerveth to clear ſome controverſies in Religion.</p>
                        <p>The Word of God is the inſtrument of our Regeneration, being made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifical and generative by the Spirit. The Father is the original cauſe:
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.18.</note> The Son is the meritorious and effective: And the Holy Ghoſt conſummates and applies it,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3.</note> through faith wrought and increaſed in us by the Word and Sacraments. So that here is God the Father's will; God the Son's merit; and God the Spirit's efficacy:

                        <p>The Regenerate mans actions are as contrary to thoſe that he did before, as fire and water; ſo that it may be ſaid of him, as it was once of <hi>Troy</hi> being taken,

                        <p>It was a ſtrange change that Satan mentioned and motioned to our Saviour of turning ſtones into bread: But nothing ſo ſtrange as the work of Regeneration and Renovation, a turning of ſtony hearts into hearts of fleſh.</p>
                        <p>In this great work, the ſubſtance of the Soul is the ſame, only the qualities and operations are altered. In Regeneration our natures are tranſlated, not deſtroyed, no not our conſtitution and complexion. The melancholy man doth not ceaſe to be ſo after converſion, only the humor is ſanctified to a fitneſs for godly ſorrow, holy meditation, &amp;c. and ſo of the other.</p>
                        <p>The fountain of bleſſed Immortality, is the new birth; which is the unmaking of a man, and the making of him up again. The whole frame of the old corrupt converſation is to be diſſolved, that a better may be erected.</p>
                        <p>The dignity and neceſſity of this work, are motive enough to labour it.

<note place="margin">His Sermon of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>pag.</hi> 68.</note> There hath been (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fox)</hi> a long contention, and much ado in the Church, to reconcile theſe two places of Scripture; but when all is ſaid that may be ſaid touching them, there is none that can better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe two different places, than you your ſelves, to whom we preach; And how is that? I will tell you (ſaith he) do you joyn the lively Faith that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, with thoſe good works that St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, and bring them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one life, and then haſt thou reconciled them; for ſo ſhalt thou be ſure to be juſtified both before God by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Faith, and before men by St. <hi>James</hi> works.</p>
                        <p>That we are juſtified only by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by Faith, is the very Baſis, Foundation and State of Chriſtian Religion, whereby it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other Religions whatſoever.

Let us therefore hold faſt this comfortable and faithful word, and tranſmit this doctrine ſafe and ſound to poſterity. It was <hi>Luthers</hi> great fear, that when he was dead, it would be loſt again out of the world.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt is in the midſt of his Church, whoſe righteouſneſs is communicated to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true Believer, who only comes within the Sphear of his activity. The more vertuous the central Agent is in any thing, the larger will his Semidiameters be, and conſequently his circumference.

                        <p>Juſtification and Sanctification are inſeperable concomitants; indeed they are not to be confounded, but withall they ought not to be ſevered; diſtinguiſhed they muſt be, divided they cannot; and therefore they are fitly called Twins in the womb of Free Grace. Hence it is that we find thoſe two frequently joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19.</p>
                        <p>One bade his Fellow at the Sun-riſing look towards the Weſt inſtead of the Eaſt, where he might the better ſee the appearance of the Sun upon the tops of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets; even ſo the aſſurance of Election is beſt ſeen in Converſion and Sanctification, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                        <p>Sanctification is an univerſal healing of all the ſinful and diſeaſed parts of the Soul; for as in Original ſin there is the ſeed plot of all evil; ſo in Regeneration, there is the Root of all actual Graces.</p>
                        <p>Therefore who ever will have the comfort of Sanctification, muſt look that they have not only illumination in their minds, but alſo renovation of their hearts. Its no advantage (with the Toad) to have a Pearl in the Head, and poyſon all over the body.</p>
                        <p>Gods children are called Temples of God, and of the Holy Ghoſt; now as the Temple conſiſted of three parts, viz. <hi>Sanctuarium, ſanctum,</hi> and <hi>ſanctum ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> ſo doth man; the body is as the outer Court, the Soul as the holy place, and the Spirit as the moſt holy, and Sanctification (as a golden vein) muſt run thorow all theſe.</p>
                        <p>When we fall into Sin, we are like unto a man which falls upon a heap of ſtones, and into the mire; ſuch a one may be quickly waſhed, but not ſo ſoon healed; even ſo Juſtification is at once, but Sanctification comes on gradually.</p>
                        <p>For it is with man, as it was with the houſe wherein was the fretting and ſpreading Leproſie, mentioned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For though that Houſe might be ſcraped round about, and much rubbiſh and corrupt materialls be removed, yet the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie did not ceaſe till the houſe, with the ſtones and timber, and morter of it, were all broken down. So 'tis with man, Grace may do much, and alter many things that were amiſs in him, and make him leave many ſins to which he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given; but to have Sin wholly caſt out, and left, that is not to be expected,

Let us intreat the Lord to ſanctifie our hearts as well as our hands; our Souls and Conſciences as well as our tongues. That is true Sanctification that begineth at the heart, and from thence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52564:52"/>floweth to all the parts. What ſhould we do with a fair and beautiful Apple, if the core be rotten? A ſtraw for an outward glorious Profeſſion, if there be no truth in the inward parts.</p>

                     <p>So is our New man born at once, though he grow by degrees; that is, the ſoul in converſion is at once re-inveſted with the Image of God in all its faculties; ſo that though the actions of Grace do not preſently appear in each one, yet the habit, the ſeed, the root of all Divine virtues, is firmly reimplanted in them, and by the ſtrength of this grace given, they are conſtantly diſpoſed to all ſanctified operations.</p>
                     <p>Well ſaid the Roman <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> That living men die, is uſual and natural; But that dead men live again, by repentance and grace, is the mighty work of God alone.</p>

                     <p>A ſinner wants grace, <hi>Non quia Deus non dat, ſed quia homo non accipit:</hi> Whereupon it follows in a Schoolmans inference, That Gods not giving, is not the cauſe of a ſinners not receiving; but rather his not receiving, is the cauſe of Gods not giving.

                        <p>It is a mutual malevolence between parties, with a mutual deſire to hurt and deſtroy each other.</p>

                        <p>But the ſharpeſt hoſtility is betwixt the godly ſeed of the Woman, and the wicked ſeed of the ſpiritual ſerpent Satan: who ſo far as he is diſcovered to be what he is indeed, is hated and abhorred of Mankind in general, as he hates all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind without exception.</p>

                        <p>The Knowledge of man is as the waters, ſome deſcending from above, and ſome ſpringing from beneath; the one informed by the light of nature, the other inſpired by divine revelation. The light of nature conſiſteth in the notions of the mind, and the reports of the ſenſes: For as for the knowledge that man receives by teaching, it is cumulative, and not original; as in a water, that beſide its own ſpring-head, is fed with other ſprings and ſtreams. And according to theſe two illuminations or originals, Knowledge is divided into Divinity and Philoſophy.</p>
                        <p>Mans Knowledge hath three beams: 1.

                        <p>Supernal and ſupernatural wiſdom, is ſuch as can neither be fathomed, nor found out by humane abilities, or by natural reaſon. <hi>Lucioſi &amp; qui hebeti ſunt viſu</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vives;)</hi> Thoſe that are weak-ſighted and ſand-blind, if at any time they look wiſhly upon any thing, with deſire to ſee it the better; they ſee it ſo much the worſe, and nothing ſo well as they did before. Think the ſame of the moſt acute and perſpicacious Naturaliſt: when he comes to look into the things of God, he is not only ſand-blind, but ſtark blind. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Therefore with Gods heifer muſt all thoſe plow, that will find out his riddles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                        <p>A man that is truly godly and ſpiritual, is the wiſeſt man; becauſe he hath the moſt excellent and profound reaſon; he hath a maſs of rationality, that the world knows not of: We may ſay of a godly man, as the Heathen ſaid of a learned man; <hi>A learned man hath four eyes, and the vulgar have but two;</hi> ſo a godly man hath three eyes, and a natural man hath but two, and ſcarce that. A natural man can reaſon things, but it is with a corrupt or natural eye; whereas a Saint can reaſon with a ſpiritual eye. And therefore you ſhall have godly perſons uſually when they are deſcribed in Scripture, they are called <hi>wiſe men,</hi> as it is often in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> The wiſe man and the fool are put in oppoſition the one to the other; the wiſe man is the godly man, and the fool is the ſinful man, let him be as wiſe as he will be.</p>
                        <p>Men that are only carnally wiſe, are only like Moles, that dig dexterouſly under ground, but are blind above ground.</p>
                        <p>Soul-light is not enough to make us truly wiſe, but there muſt alſo be Spirit-light. The whole man is corrupted, and therefore the wiſdom of man is corrupt alſo. There is a maim in the Intellectuals and higher faculties, and not only in the Senſual appetite. All the diſcourſes of the Underſtanding, till it be ſanctified, are but ſottiſh and fooliſh. And therefore (as <hi>James</hi> intimates) if Wiſdom be meerly natural, 'twill be preſently deviliſh.</p>

                        <p>It is the bottome grace, eſpecially commending us to God. It is conceived not to be ſo properly a diſtinct grace, as the perfection of every grace. Its the filling up of all our duties; without this they are as empty ſounds.</p>
                        <p>A ſincere man is like a Chryſtal-Glaſs with a light in the midſt, which appeareth through every part thereof, ſo as that truth within, breaketh out in every parcel of his life. There is in his obedience to God, 1. An univerſality. 2. Uniformity. 3 Ubiquity. He hath reſpect unto all Gods Commandments, ſo far as he knows them; without prejudice or partiality; and is the ſame at home as abroad, in the cloſet as in the Congregation. His faith is unfained, his love cordial, his wiſdom undiſſembled, his repentance a renting of the heart; he truly aims at pleaſing God, and not at by-reſpects.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt is ſaid to be girt about the paps with a golden girdle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13.

In the firſt age of the Church, they wore their girdle about their middle, but the more ſpiritual they became, their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52564:66"/>girdle went the more upward. To this the Apoſtle may ſeem to allude, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. And truely here (as one ſaith well) if ever <hi>unbelt unbleſt;</hi> he is a looſe man that wants this girdle of ſincerity.</p>

And whereas it may be ſaid, that it often falls out that uprightneſs is oppreſſed; This is eaſily anſwered, if we conſider, 1. That many of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamities that befal godly perſons, are not ſimply evils (as the world judgeth) but rather markes of ſpecial honour God puts upon them. <hi>Jobs</hi> body was full of ulcers, but his heart was pure; and thoſe tribulations he grapled with, were onely probatory, to trie his ſtrength, to draw out his graces, and increaſe his glory. 2. We muſt not limit God to every moment of time, when he will honour and cleer his people: The world at firſt was a confuſed <hi>Chaos,</hi> but at the end of ſix dayes, it was a curious work: So God hath his time, and we ſhould not deſire God ſhould break off his work, before he hath made an end of it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11.

                           <hi>Zeal</hi> without knowledge, is dangerous, as appeared in the Jews, and doth in many others; It makes men proud, and having drunk in an opinion, they cannot be removed with reaſon. As a man cannot write in a paper already written, nor plow in a ground over-runne with buſhes; ſo it is hard to faſten any reaſon upon a mind prepoſſeſt with fancy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Zeal</hi> is ſuch a thing, which if it be well ordered, is moſt beautiful in a Chriſtian, but if not, a thing of exceeding danger: as fire in moderation is moſt comfortable, in extremity moſt fearful.</p>
                        <p>Seperate <hi>Zeal</hi> and knowledge, and they become both unprofitable: But wiſely join them, and they perfect a Chriſtian, being like a precious Diamond in a Ring of Gold. For <hi>Zeal</hi> without knowledge, is like a little ſhip, without ballaſt and fraught, but with a great many ſailes, which is ſoon either daſht againſt the rocks, or topped over. And knowledge without <hi>Zeal,</hi> is like a goodly great ſhip, well ballaſted, and richly fraughted, but without any ſailes, which quickly falleth into the hands of Pirates, becauſe it can make no ſpeed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected alwayes in a good matter;</hi> but <hi>Zeal</hi> miſplaced, how dangerous is it! It is better to creep in a good way, than to run in a wrong way. Even idleneſs is better than ſuch dillgence. Yet they who miſplace their <hi>Zeal,</hi> are commonly more in diligence, than they who place it aright; and they who are in a falſe way, make more haſt, than they who are in a true. The nature of man will carry him two miles at his own bidding, rather than one at Gods.</p>

                           <hi>Zeal</hi> without knowledge is as wild-fire in a fooles hand: it is like the Devil in the Demoniack, that caſts him ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes into the water.</p>

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> We muſt uſe moderation in meats and drinks. This moderation is to eat and drink with perpetual abſtinence. And abſtinence is to take leſs than that which nature deſires, and not more. And that meaſure of meat and drink, which ſerves to refreſh nature, and to make us fit for the ſervice of God and man, is allowed us of God, and no more.</p>
                        <p>We muſt uſe moderation in our apparel. And that is to apparel our ſelves according to our ſex, according to the received faſhion of our Country, according to our place and degree, and according to our ability. Here the common fault is, to be out of all order: for none almoſt know any meaſure.</p>
                        <p>We muſt uſe moderation in getting of goods. And that is, to reſt content if we have food and raiment for our ſelves, and them that belong unto us, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.8. Here is our flint; We may not deſire to be rich, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. The King himſelf muſt not multiply his gold and ſilver, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.17. And yet hath he more need of gold and ſilver, than any private man.</p>
                        <p>There muſt be a moderation in the ſpending of our goods. Contrary to the faſhion of many, that ſpend their ſubſtance in feaſting, and company, and keep their wives and children bare at home.</p>

                        <p>There are ſome who are called civil honeſt men, and many conceit that theſe are good men; and not a few, that theſe are in a middle ſtate between good and evil; but the truth is, there is nothing between a godly and wicked man, no <hi>medium</hi> of participation between theſe extreames.</p>
                        <p>Good and evil (in a remiſs degree) may mingle in the ſame ſubject; but no mans perſon is in a middle ſtate between good and evil. Scripture ſets all men in two orders, to ſhew this diviſion runs through the whole world. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                        <p>He is to be numbred among the wicked. 1. In whom ſin reigneth. He yielding ready and free obedience to it, as to his natural Lord. 2. He that is a cuſtomary ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or driveth a trade in ſin. Inſtead of pleading againſt ſin, (which a godly man doth) pleading for it. And inſtead of making prepuration to reſiſt the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> 3. A wicked man preſerves in himſelf a purpoſe to ſin, whiles he ſeems to pray and proteſt againſt it; (as <hi>Aug.</hi> before his converſion.) He may put up prayers againſt ſin, but he puts up no deſires againſt it. As ſinful cuſtome is the rode of his life, ſo ſinful purpoſes are the rode of his heart. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.21. 4. Wickedneſſe carries fulneſſe of conſent in ſin.<note place="margin">Olim haec me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſſe juvabit.</note> A wicked man may have many checks at ſin, and ſome motions to good, from his conſcience; but he hath none from his will; ſo that as he is taken captive at Satans will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. So alſo at his own will: The Devil takes him captive when he pleaſeth, and he is pleaſed to be taken captive by the Devil. 5. Where there is wickedneſſe in ſinning, there is delight in ſin. Pure delight in ſin, is impureſt wickedneſſe. To delight in ſin, as ſin; is inconſiſtent with any degree of grace.</p>

To work an abomination or a lye; is more than to do an abomination, or to tell a lye. It notes a perſon not onely induſtrious, but alſo crafty; Or (as the Prophet ſpeakes) <hi>wiſe to do evil, Jer.</hi> 4.22. So that wickedneſſe denotes not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but great ſin; for though every wicked man be a ſinner, yet every ſinner is not properly a wicked man.</p>
                        <p>It's a fearful ſigne of a man given over by God, to be forward, eager, craftily and coveteouſly ſinful; ſo was <hi>Judas,</hi> who having left the Lord, the Lord left him: And if the Lord once leave us, fire ſhall ſooner ceaſe to flie upward, than we ſhall ceaſe to purſue ſin, with greedineſſe; and in this purſuit ſhall be as little able to ſtay our ſelves, as a man running down a ſteep hill, that cannot recover himſelf, till he come at the bottome.</p>

The miſerable men deſired him to ſpare his life; The revengeful man ſaid he would do it, on condition he would renounce God, and all the benefits of his ſoul; Though this was hard to the poor man, yet fear of death makes him renounce God and Salvation, upon which that wretched malicious enemy killeth him, with this boaſt, <hi>Now he had ſatisfied his revenge, for he had not onely killed his body, but damned his ſoul.</hi> It is a great depravity in our natures, and ſurely an affection that ſavoureth of hell; to comfort our ſelves in the ſufferings of others: But to procure the miſeries of others in thoſe extremities, wherein we hold an hope to have no ſociety ourſelves, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a ſtrain above <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and a project beyond the primary ſeduction of hell.</p>

                        <p>A divine ordinance or tradition, is a doctrine, firſt delivered from God, and written down afterwards for the uſe of the Church; This we are bound to beleeve abſolutely.

                        <p>The Phariſees had many traditions and unwritten verities; pretended to be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſcribed them by their Elders; that by the obſervation thereof, they might be the better enabled to keep Gods commandements.

She being thus brought to the place of execution, was let down by a ladder into the hollow cave, and the hole preſently ſtopped. And the reaſon why they ſuffered ſuch a kind of death, was, becauſe they thought it not fit, that ſhe ſhould be burnt with fire, which kept not the ſacred fire with greater ſanctity.

The ſpring and original of the ſenſes (ſaith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) is in the common ſenſe, ſeated in the fore-part of the head: This differeth from the reſt of the ſenſes, as the root from the branches, or as a line drawn from the point.</p>
                        <p>Our ſenſes are inlets to the underſtanding; and therefore the ſenſes of the body are advantagious to the mind: The eye doth not ſee for it ſelf, or for the body only, but the eye ſees for the underſtanding: The like may be ſaid of the reſt of the ſenſes. They may be ſervants to ſin, or ſervants to grace. Let not therefore thoſe ſenſes which God hath given us, both for natural uſes to the body, and for ſpiritual uſes to the ſoul, be abuſed and turned to the diſſervice of the body, much leſs to the deſtruction and damnation of the ſoul.

                        <p>The ſoul gives unto the body a threefold motion:</p>

By the Pulſe, which is begun at the heart, and made continually to beat; and this beating of the heart begets thoſe ſparkles, which we call vital ſpirits, ariſing out of the fineſt of the blood; which ſpirits are carried by the pulſe thorow the arteries, and they ſhine in the whole body, according as their paſſages are more or leſs open. 2. And by Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which aire is both fetcht in continually, for the cooling of natural heat in the heart, and the ſpirits refreſhed, as alſo the groſs and more ſmoky ſpirits are exhaled out of the breaſt.</p>

                           <hi>Duplex eſt actus rationis</hi> (ſay the Schoolmen) <hi>Primus &amp; ſecundus: Ita &amp; duplex actus ſcientiae, primus &amp; ſecundus.</hi> There is in an Infant the firſt act of reaſon, when he beginneth to ſpeak; and the ſecond act, when he beginneth to learn: So then (ſay they) the firſt act of knowledge, is the ſecond act of reaſon. An Infant
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52564:105"/>hath the firſt act of reaſon, but not the ſecond; And a learned man, when he is ſleeping, hath the firſt act of knowledge, but not the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>Reaſon is that faculty or power of the ſoul, whereby we debate and diſcourſe of things and objects, that we may be able ſoundly to judge of that which we rightly underſtand. Sometimes it is taken for the uſe of this faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſcretion. <hi>Act.</hi> 25.27.</p>
                        <p>Or, Reaſon is a faculty of the ſoul, wherein men excell all creatures in this viſible world. This is admirable, for by the light of this man can conceive of things, as well as by ſenſe; yea, of things that never were in the ſenſes. It can conceive of the nature of God, and diſcern him from his works. It can conceive of things by a diſcerning reflection; conceiving of it ſelf, and underſtanding that it doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. It can diſtinguiſh between good and evil, truth and falſhood, <hi>viz.</hi> the moral goodneſs of things. It can in a ſmall moment of time go almoſt over the whole world, and view it all. It can (in a ſort) invent things that never were in being, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And yet bare reaſon is further from grace, than ſenſe is from reaſon. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between mans nature and grace, is greater than that between mans nature and a beaſt's. It is as eaſie to change a beaſt into a man, or to make a beaſt underſtand reaſon; as to change a Sinner into a Saint, or to make an Infidel a Believer.</p>
                        <p>Neither is meer humane reaſon any competent Surveyer of the wayes of God. Not that any of the wayes of God are againſt reaſon, but many of them are above our reaſon; the wayes of God are ordered by the quinteſcence of reaſon, but in which of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> is that to be found? When we meaſure the wayes of God by the ſtandard and ſcantlings of our reaſon, what a diſguiſe do we put upon them? Yea, how do we diſguiſe God himſelf? We make him a Juſtice, a Mercy—like our own,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.8.</note> what a God do we make of him? <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And ſhall any reduce and ſhrink up the thoughts and wayes of God, to their narrow and ſtraitned model? The Lord ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> in ſcorne, when he attempted a likeneſſe to God, <hi>Behold, the man is become as one of us,
<note place="margin">Gen 3.22.</note> to know good and evil.</hi> How then doth God ſcorne them, that would make his wayes and thoughts as their own?</p>
                        <p>When therefore we are apt to think there is no reaſon for that, for which we our ſelves can ſee no reaſon; Conſider, What if God ſhould appear and tell thee, It ſhall be thus, and the reaſon of it is, becauſe I will have it ſo? Is not that anſwer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to any man? The will of God is reaſon enough, and ought to be the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Many there are in the world, whoſe actings out-run their reaſon; they ſpeak they know not what, and they do they know not why; In a word, they are more buſie than wiſe. The inadvertency of ſuch, our Saviour made the ground of his Prayer,

                        <p>As the mind or underſtanding is the higheſt faculty of the ſoul; ſo the reaſonings are the moſt immediate and higheſt acts of the mind.

                        <p>Two main motives to prayer, are, 1. Our neceſſities are many, for ſoul and body; we are as houſes that ſtand in need of continual reparations. 2.

The fathers of the Greek Church called theſe holy Rites myſteries, becauſe the ſubſtance of them was onely known to the members of the Church, and hidden from others; ſo the ancient Teachers of the Latine Church called them Sacraments, becauſe of the affinity and nearneſs between them and a Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>Indeed a ſigne and ſeal differ one from another, as the generall from the the eſpecial; for every ſeal is a ſigne, but every ſigne is not a ſeal. A ſeal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth, aſſureth and confirmeth a thing; a ſigne onely ſheweth it, but a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth both.

                        <p>The word of God may fitly be reſembled to writings or evidences, and the Sacraments to ſeals, which the Lord alone putteth unto his own letters. Now God addeth them to the Word, not that the Word was not ſufficient without them; but for an help to our weakneſſe; that we might have lively pawnes before our eyes, of thoſe things which we hear with our ears. And theſe he hath ordained to be ſeals of the Covenant of grace; which although not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full on Gods part, who is alwayes better than his word, yet are very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſuccour us, who are prone to doubting: The Lord therefore hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to give us greater aſſurance, even as a Seale to a writing makes it more authentical. So that Sacraments are as a viſible Sermon, preaching unto us moſt lively the promiſes of God; that as the word we hear doth edifie and inſtruct the mind by the outward ears, ſo do the Sacraments by the eyes and other ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>The eſſential parts of a Sacrament, are either,

                              <item>1. Outward, which hath the ſigne, with the ceremony ordained, and the word, Or,</item>
                              <item>2. Inward, which is the matter or thing ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaving benefits of Chriſt Jeſus, and the priviledges of the Covenant of Grace; that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, regeneration, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Hence we muſt eſteem Sacraments, not according to their outward value, but according to the bleſſing annexed in their lawful uſe. For in as much as they are ſignifications and ſeals of ſuch excellent things; they are with all
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52564:114"/>reverence to be handled and eſteemed, even as means which exhibit to us, and confirm the beſt bleſſings of God.</p>
                        <p>Yet neither the Word, not Sacraments profit any thing without the Spirit; this grace proceedeth from the holy Ghoſt, who is unto our faith as marrow unto the bones, as moiſture unto the tree, and as a comfortable rain unto the fruits of the earth: If this inward Maſter and Teacher be wanting, the Sacraments can work no more in our mindes, than if the bright Sun ſhould ſhine to the blind eyes, or a loud voice ſound in deaf ears, or fruitful corn fall into the barren wilderneſſe, or a ſhower of rain fall upon the hard-ſtones. Hence whenſoever we come unto theſe aright, the Spirit worketh in us, mollifying the hardneſſe of our hearts, framing us unto new obedience, and aſſuring us that God offereth to us his own Sonne for our juſtification and ſalvation. Therefore learn when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we come to the Word and Sacraments, to crave the gracious aſſiſtance of the bleſſed Spirit, to guide, direct, and regenerate us to eternal life; to ſanctifie us, and to aſſure us of Gods endleſſe favour in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                        <p>Wiſe men ever take a freedom of reproving, eſpecially when vice is bold and daring: for when Modeſty dies, Vertue is then upon the vaniſh.</p>
                        <p>Seaſonable ſpeech falling upon a prepared heart, hath oft a ſtrong and ſweet operation.</p>
                        <p>Friends (as Bees) are killed with the honey of Flattery, but quickned with the vinegar of Reproof. The Eagle, though ſhe love her young ones dearly, yet ſhe pincheth and beateth them out of the neſt.</p>
                        <p>We muſt reprove mildly and lovingly, with ſoft words, but hard arguments. Gentle ſhowers comfort the earth, where daſhing ſhowers drown the ſeed. A gentle reproof may ſoften, where a greater doth but harden.</p>
                        <p>Some warmth muſt be in a reproof, but it muſt not be ſcalding hot.<note place="margin">Aegros quos potus fortis non curavit, ad ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem priſtinam aqua tepens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocavit.</note> They that could not be cured with ſtrong Potions (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) have been recovered with warm water.</p>
                        <p>We muſt take heed that our reproofs be not grounded upon miſtakes. It is eaſie to blame what we do not apprehend. Many disfigure the opinions and practiſes of others, with conceits of their own. As the perſons of the primitive Chriſtians were often put into Lions or Bears skins, by their barbarous and Heatheniſh perſecutors, and then baited with dogs; So are the matters of too many later Chriſtians debated.</p>
                        <p>We muſt alſo have a care, that in reproving other mens faults, we run not into the ſame our ſelves: We muſt not reprove pride with pride, check paſſion with paſſion, or ſpeak againſt bitterneſs of ſpirit, with a bitter ſpirit. It's poſſible our own corruptions may riſe up againſt the corruptions of others; But 'tis very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to hear ſin chiding vice.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Correct thy friend ſecretly, and commend him openly. Do not blab and blaze his fault abroad, to his grief and diſgrace; but clap a plaiſter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof upon the ſore, and then (Chirurgion-like) cover it with thy hand, that the world may be never the wiſer.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52564:122"/>by the ſenſes.

                        <p>The Papiſts were uſed to ſay, the ſacrifice of the Maſs, that it was propitiatory for the quick and the dead; but being forced to it by the light of Scripture, they let go that hold, and affirm that it is onely <hi>repreſentativum, commemorativum &amp; appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativum</hi> of the ſacrifice on the croſſe. But however they minſe it, all the ſacrifices inſtituted by God muſt ceaſe, after the oblation of that ſacrifice, whereby eternal redemption is obtained for us. And then this new forged ſacrifice, is but a bird of their own hatching, and muſt ceaſe. Beſides, if Chriſt be offered up in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, then he ſuffers at every Maſs; for there can be no offering of Chriſt without ſuffering: but he ſuffers not, even in the judgment of the Papiſts: Neither <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor any of them all can (though full of ſhifts) tell handſomely how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude this Argument.

She is no chaſt wife that gives any other man the uſe of her body, with Proteſtation ſhe keeps her heart to her husband. 4. God will have no ſuch heart reſerved for him, he will have no part of a divided man: He is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth; not in ſpirit and falſhood.</p>
                        <p>For the Preſence: A number of ſcandals are infolded. 1. Here is a denial of Chriſt, and of the faith; which were it in the heart, it would be confeſſed in the mouth. Here's a daſtardly joyning with the enemy againſt Chriſt. For he that is not with him, is againſt him. And what union between Chriſt and an Idol? 2. A ſcandal in his own conſcience, allowing himſelf in that which he condemneth, <hi>Rom.</hi>

                        <p>For, among many anſwers; The text ſhews, 1. That <hi>Naaman</hi> confeſſed it a ſin; And how then can any hence prove it to be none? 2. That he prayed twice againſt it; And what thou prayeſt, thou muſt do. 3. He profeſſeth he will never worſhip any now, but the true God. 4. He craves the Prophets prayers, that he may never be drawn contrary to his purpoſe: To which part the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Go in peace;</hi> not giving him leave to bow before <hi>Rimmon,</hi> but promiſing his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he bids him farewel. 5. <hi>Naaman</hi> might have pleaded a calling, yet that would not ſerve, nor ſatisfie his conſcience: How much leſs theirs, that plead only for new-fangledneſs, and a raſh running out of their way, ſo ſinning without a cauſe?</p>
                        <p>Nor let any ſay, Thoſe were Heathen Idols; the Maſs is not ſo bad, it hath ſome
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52564:122"/>good things in it concerning God and Chriſt. For, the Maſs is as groſs Idolatry, as ever the Heathens committed, who never worſhipped a baſer thing than a piece of Bread. And let them tell us a difference between bodily fornication of Heathens and Chriſtians, and we will conceive the ſame in the ſpiritual whoredom of Pagans and Papiſts. <hi>But let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches: Come out from amongſt them, and touch no unclean thing.</hi>

                        <p>I wiſh Travellers in forein Nations would obſerve this. Experience ſhews, how alluring the Antichriſtian Harlot is, how many are daily won to her Idolatry. Many that have frequented their Maſſes, conceiving it no great harm to be preſent there, if they can pretend to keep their heart to God; (proving Neutrals, Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Cakes half-baked,) have had their hearts given up to horrible deluſion, infection, and final deſtruction.

                        <p>By the deſcription ſet down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. the Ark, in ſhape, was like to a Coffin for a mans body, ſix times ſo long as it was broad, and ten times ſo long as it was high: And ſo fit to figure out Chriſts death and burial, and ours with him, by mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the old man; whereby we are become dead and buried with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 6.</p>
                        <p>This Ark, in the judgment of all Interpreters, was a type of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The Ark was made after God's appointment, not <hi>Noah's:</hi> So the Church muſt be framed by God's will, not by man's. All were drowned, that were not in the Ark: So all (regularly) are damned, that are not in the Catholick Church. The Ark was neer drowning, yet never drowned: So the Church may be brought to a low ebbe, yet it ſhall continue ſtill. There was in the Ark good and bad, clean and unclean: So we muſt never dream to have all holy and ſanctified perſons that be in the Church. In the Ark there were divers manſions and rooms, ſome for men, ſome for beaſts: And, <hi>In my Fathers houſe there are many dwelling places. Noah</hi> and his family were ſaved in the Ark, yet with much ado; they endured much, they were in continual danger, they paſſed through many difficulties, the ſmell of beaſts, little outward light, the Ark ready to ruſh on rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: So the children of God ſhall be ſaved, yet through many tribulations. Laſtly, the Ark had but a few in it, eight perſons, yet there was the Church; Univerſality is no neceſſary note of a Church. Chriſts flock is but a little flock.</p>

                        <p>It had upon it a Crown of Gold; to ſet forth the Majeſty of Chriſt's Kingdom, or the eternity of his Deity; which, as a crown or circle, had neither beginning nor end.

And here is the firſt broaching of plurality of Gods, which ſince this time hath multiplied to an innumerable rabble of falſe gods. Of Divine powers adored by the heathens, <hi>Heſiod</hi> reckons up thirty thouſand that were in his time: What an Army, may we think there were of them in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages? It is ſaid, that in <hi>China</hi> are no fewer than an hundred thouſand Idols. See Mr. <hi>Fullers Pantheon.</hi> But all religious ſervice done to any, but God, is manifeſtly condemned as impious. Be the gods of the Heathens good fellows, the true God is a jealous God, and will not ſhare his glory with another. Read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6.</p>
                        <p>Worſhip is either,
<list>
                              <item>1. Civil. Or,</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>The former may be given to men, and it is twofold,
<list>
                              <item>1. A civil worſhip of duty, from inferiours to their Superiors, as from children to their Parents, from ſervants to their Maſters, from ſubjects to their Magiſtrates.</item>
                              <item>2. A civil worſhip of curteſie, which is from equals, when one equal will bow to another, or when a Superior bows down to his inferiour.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the latter is Gods peculiar. For nothing but God, or that which we make a God, is or can be worſhipped. Either he is a God whom we worſhip, or (as much as in us lies) we make him one. Whatever creature ſhares in this honour, this honour <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> ſets it up above, and makes it more than a creature. The very Heathens thought every thing below a God, below worſhip.</p>
                        <p>Indeed Papiſts have worſhip for creatures, and they have diſtinction for it, but no Scripture for it. They tell us of their <hi>Latria,</hi> worſhip onely proper to God, and <hi>Dulia,</hi> which is for Saints, and <hi>Huperdulia,</hi> which is for the Virgin
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52564:126"/>
                           <hi>Mary,</hi> and for the ſigne of the Croſſe. Thus they make vain diſtinctions, which God and the Scripture make not. They that invent a worſhip, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a doctrine to maintain it by. And indeed vain diſtinctions are good enough to maintain vain ſuperſtitions.</p>
                        <p>This divine worſhip of God is twofold,
<list>
                              <item>1. Internal. and</item>

                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The former is to love God, fear God, and truſt upon him: Theſe are acts of inward worſhip. The latter is nothing elſe but the ſerving of the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own inſtitution,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Such as love to vaunt themſelves, and out of oſtentation to ſet forth their good parts to publick view; may be compared to a veſſel without a cover, touching which the Law ſaith, that it ſhall be counted unclean.

                        <p>Divines obſerve, there are ſeven ſeaſons of ſpeaking. 1. When we may bring glory to God, and do good to our brethren. 2. When we have an opportunity to vindicate the honour and truth of God. 3. When we may relieve the credit of a brother that is wronged, 4. When we may inſtruct or direct thoſe that are ignorant. 5. When we may comfort or ſupport thoſe that are weak. 6. When we may reſolve and ſettle thoſe that are in doubt. 7. When we may duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and convince thoſe that do evil.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo ſeven ſpecial ſeaſons of ſilence. 1. Till we have a call. 2. Till we be rightly informed about the ſtate of the matter or thing to which we muſt ſpeak. 3. Neither may we ſpeak raſhly, without ſutable preparation, either actual or habitual. 4. Nor when, what we ſpeak is like to be a ſnare unto our ſelves, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10, 12. with <hi>verſe</hi> 13. 5. So likewiſe, nor when our own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or corruptions are up. 6. Nor when men are not capable of what we ſpeak. 7. Nor to burthen or grieve the ſpirits of any, eſpecially of thoſe that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy afflicted.</p>
                        <p>I conclude then, it is a great part of prudence to know when to be ſilent, and when to ſpeak: when it is a time to ſpeak, ſilence is our folly: and when it is a time to keep ſilence, ſpeaking is our folly.</p>

He takes away the corrupt gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but not the uſe of an Oath, as may appeare in all the other precepts there reformed, but not aboliſhed. Again, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ne juretis omnino,</hi> ſo he ſaid, <hi>Ne reſiſtatis malo;</hi> yet the Magiſtrate may reſiſt evil.</p>
                        <p>There were two gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in this.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. If any ſware by the Name of God, or by thoſe things that did appertaine immediately to the worſhip of God, as by the gold offered to God in the Temple or by the ſacrifice on the Altar, he ſinned: But if he did ſweare by other creatures, by heaven, earth, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Altar; it was no ſinne.</item>
                           <item>2. That the breach of the firſt Oath was damnable, but not of the ſecond. Theſe Chriſt reformeth. Moreover the <hi>Phariſees</hi> meant onely of private Oaths, in the ordinary ſpeech of men; for in publick judgement, they did ſwear onely by God alone. Beſides, if it were unlawful to ſwear, how ſhall Chriſt be juſtified, that addes to his ſpeech. Amen, Amen.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Indeed for reformation of this vice of blaſphemy and ordinary ſwearing, whereby (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith) Chriſt is continually crucified again, it were to be wiſhed, that that Law made by <hi>Ludovicus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> were univerſally eſtabliſhed, That whoſoever ſweareth vainly, ſhould be burned in the mouth with an hot iron.</p>
                        <p>An Oath (ſaith <hi>Tully</hi>) is <hi>affirmatio religioſa.</hi> It is <hi>lex naturae,</hi>

                        <p>It muſt be, 1. For the confirmation of a truth, not of a falſehood. It is a moſt vile thing to make God who is truth it ſelf, the witneſſe of a lie. 2. In judgement, with wiſdome and diſcretion, upon great and weighty cauſes: When the glory of God, and the good of our brethren requires it; When the truth cannot otherwiſe he known. 3. For juſt and lawful matters, not for things that are unjuſt and unlawful; we muſt not ſwear to kill, to take a purſe, or the like. Unto the firſt of theſe are oppoſed falſe Oaths, to the ſecond raſh, to the third unjuſt.</p>
                        <p>The depravation of our Nature hath abuſed the lawful act of an Oath, by equivocations and mental reſervations; making it like the Gipſies knot, faſt or looſe, at pleaſure.

                        <p>Sin makes a man a debtor;<note place="margin">Grave votabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum debitorts.</note> And (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) the name of debtor is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing; yet ſuch is every ſinner, a debtor to Gods Juſtice, by reaſon of the breach of his law. Indeed, man as a creature was a debtor to Gods authority commanding, but withal, he was able to pay that debt to the full, and therefore it was no burden nor miſery: whereas man as a ſinner, is a debtor to Gods Juſtice puniſhing; and this ſuch a debt as he is never able to ſatisfy, and therefore muſt lye in priſon for ever. A ſinner may be red with bluſhing at the time of ſinning, but muſt needs be oftentimes pale for fear of paying. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> would fain buy his pillow who was ſo much in debt, as conceiving it was good to ſleep on. How can a ſinner ſleep ſecurely, who is indebted ſo deeply?</p>
                        <p>But now forgiveneſs taketh off this obligation, and conſequently the puniſhment it ſelf: ſo that look as a forgiven debtor is freed from whatſoever penalty his debt did render him liable to; yea, from being ſo much as liable to the penalty; ſo is the forgiven ſinner from the puniſhment it ſelf, which is the remote term, and the obligation to it, which is the proxime term of Pardon, In this reſpect it is that <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſaith, to forgive ſin, is not to puniſh it. And <hi>Austin</hi> to the like purpoſe. And the ſchools.</p>
                        <p>For know, there's a great difference between theſe two, to withold the Execution off, and to withdraw the obligation to the puniſhment: It is one thing for a creditor to give day of payment, and another thing to cancel the bond. A vaſt difference between forgiving and forbearing mercy. This latter God vouchſafeth even to thoſe who go on in ſin; but the former onely to his own penitent ſervants.</p>

                        <p>A ſolitary condition is a ſad condition, a ſorrowful condition. Indeed there is a ſolitarineſſe which is the ſweeteſt part of our lives, when we retire awhile from the world, from the throng of men and buſineſſe, that we may be more intimate with Chriſt, and take our fill in communion with him: This is to go alone, that we may meet with God in heaven upon earth: But to be ſo left alone, that we cannot meet with men, is one of the greateſt afflictions upon the earth. Such ſolitary times are ſad times.</p>
                        <p>There is an elective aloneneſſe or retiredneſſe, at ſometimes very uſeful for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and prayer; and thus we are never leſſe alone, than when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for then God is more ſpecially with us, and we with him. It is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Jacob</hi> was left alone; that is, he ſtayed alone purpoſely, that he might have freer communion with God, in that receſſe and retirement from the creature,</p>
                        <p>So the Church gets her into the clefts of the roks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sed quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſolitudo corporis, ſi non ſit ſolitudo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis?</hi> Greg.</note>

Thus it is good for man to be alone from the company of man, that he may enjoy (more fully) the preſence of God. It's a deſirable ſolitarineſſe, to talk with God, and with our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſolitarineſſe is to be well and carefully managed; for Satan is readieſt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, when none is by to aſſiſt. Neither is there a greater tye to conſtancy than the ſociety of the Saints. This the Heathen Perſecutors perceived, and therefore baniſhed and confined the confeſſors to Iſles and Mines, where they could not come
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52564:135"/>together for mutual edification. Communion of Saints is to be accounted a point of practice, as well as an Article of belief.</p>

                        <p>Thus if we ſpeak metaphorically, that's not onely a way, which we tread with our feet, but that's alſo a way, which we tread with our actions. A right courſe of life, is a right way. Go here (ſaith God) it is a way of holineſſe; go there, it is the way of juſtice; Come hither, this is the way of truth; Thus God beckens and invites man into his way. And ſurely there's no ſafety out of Gods way; many have died in Chriſts way, but no man ever periſhed in it.</p>

No, it were a fault not to anſwer: Silence is ſometime a ſign of conſent; but ſuch ſilence is rather a ſigne of contempt. Not to anſwer when called, is incivility in moſt, and it is undutifulneſs in ſome: If a ſervant anſwer not when he is called, he forgets what his calling is. The Apoſtle forbids ſervants ſome kind of anſwering. There is a twofold anſwering; 1. By way of ſubmiſſion, or an anſwer of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. When maſters give lawful commands, ſervants muſt give anſwer by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And indeed, Coming, and Going, and Doing, are the beſt language of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52564:141"/>ſervants: 'Tis moſt comely when they ſpeak with their feet, and make anſwer with their hands. 2.

                        <p>To love our enemies, is a hard task, but Chriſt commands it, and it muſt be done, be it never ſo contrary to our foul nature. The ſpirit that is in us luſteth after envy, but the Scripture teacheth better things, and God giveth more grace.</p>

Pity, which is the praiſe of humanity, and the fruit of a Chriſtian love, is by him thrown over the bar: As for Favour, the falſe advocate of the gracious, he allows him not to appear in the Court; there only Cauſes are heard ſpeak, not Perſons: Truth muſt ſtrip her, and come in naked to his bar, without falſe bodies or colours; A Bribe or a Letter on the Bench, or a word of a Grate man, are anſwered with an angry repulſe: Diſpleaſure, Revenge and Recompence ſtand on both ſides the Bench, but he regards them not, only he looks at Equity right before him. His hand is flower than his tongue; but when he is urged by occaſion, either to doom or execution, he ſhews how he abhorreth merciful Injuſtice; his forehead is rugged and ſevere, able to diſcountenance villany. I know not whether he be more feared or loved, his affections are ſo ſweetly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; The good fear him lovingly, the mild ſort love him fearfully, and only the wicked man fears him ſlaviſhly.

                        <p>To give counſel is a work of the wiſe, and they who are moſt unwiſe have moſt need of counſel, though they ſeldome think ſo.

                        <p>Reformation is a work, that hath ever gone heavily on, and hath met with much oppoſition. <hi>Luther</hi> compared the Cardinals and Prelates that met at <hi>Rome</hi> about reformation of the Church, to Foxes, that came to ſweep an houſe full of duſt with their tails: and inſtead of ſweeping it out, ſwept it all about the houſe, and made a great ſmoke for the while: but when they were gone, the duſt fell all down again.</p>
                        <p>Publick reſpects ſhould be the rapt motion to carry our hearts contrary to the wayes of our own private reſpects, or concernments: For conſider, as it is not the toſſing in a ſhip, but the ſtomack that cauſeth ſickneſſe; the choler within, and not the waves without: So, the frowardneſſe of men that quarrel with Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the work it ſelf, which is Gods commandment.</p>
                        <p>Magiſtrates are to have the main ſtroke in Reformation of Religion, but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt alſo move in their own orbe, and do their part too.</p>

                        <p>Princes are like the Sun, and great Subjects are like the Dials; if the Sun ſhine not on the Dial, no man will look on it. Wicked purpoſes are eaſily checked, not eaſily broken off; <hi>Sauls</hi> ſword is ſcarce dry from the blood of the Philiſtines, when it thirſts anew for the blood of <hi>David; Saul</hi> rent <hi>Samuels</hi> garment, now <hi>David Sauls;</hi> both were ſignificant; the rending of the one, ſignified the Kingdome torne out of thoſe unworthy hands; the cutting of the other, that the life of <hi>Saul</hi> might have been as eaſily cut off. Both ſignes and ſymptoms of mutability.</p>
                        <p>The greateſt changes are incident to the greateſt perſons. Rulers of times become captives, and they who ſate on Thrones, live in Priſons. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly image did degenerate and gradually abaſe from a head of gold, to a breaſt and armes of ſilver, thence to belly and thighes of braſſe, to legges of iron, and feet of iron and clay. All theſe repreſented ſome Kings and Kingdoms falling, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers riſing upon their ruines, till a Kingdom do ariſe, which ſhould never fall.</p>
                        <p>The moſt durable creatures are changeable; the heavens are an emblem of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, yet in a periſhing condition; and ſhall be (if not totally annihilated, yet) much altered from what they are; as will amount to this; They are no more. The mountains and rocks change ordinarily by the power of time, every mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath the ſeed of corruption in it, and therefore muſt corrupt naturally, though God ſhould not deſtroy it providentially or judiciarily.</p>
                        <p>Man is a very mutable creature; In his body, ſuffering every day an alteration, perfective or corruptive; yea, while he is growing ſtronger, haſting not only to weakneſſe, but to diſſolution. Farther, conſider him in reference to his mind, we uſe to ſay of ſeveral men, ſo many men, ſo many minds. And for his civil ſtate,

                        <p>Man hath three great changes
<list>
                              <item>1. In his outward condition, a change from weakneſſe to ſtrength, from poverty to riches, from ſorrow to joy.</item>
                              <item>2. Death is the great change of mankind: The Saints change for the better, wicked men for the worſe.</item>
                              <item>3. At the Reſurrection; for <hi>this corruptible muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Only mortality is the ſtage of mutability: for beyond this world there are no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Heaven and Hell a ſtate of eternal bleſſedneſſe or wretchedneſſe, have no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in them, nor anything that is Heterogeneal, or of another kind. Heaven which hath light and joy in it, hath no darkneſſe, no ſorrow at all in it; Hell which hath darkneſſe and ſorrow in it, hath no light nor joy at all in it: Mixtures and changes are made here on earth, when our laſt change is fully come, we ſhall go beyond all changes.</p>

We had need to <hi>prove the ſpirits whether they be of God.</hi> Many have pretended inſtincts, inſpirations, Revelations immediate and extraordinary; <hi>Montanus</hi> had his <hi>Paraclete;</hi> Curſed <hi>Mahomet</hi> called the dead fits of his falling-ſickneſſe, his extaſie and raviſhment at the appearance of the Angel <hi>Gabriel;</hi> and his Dove inured to fetch food out of his ear, is pretended no leſſe than the Holy Ghoſt, ſent whiſperingly to intimate what he ſhould enact for the people. Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Politicians had like pretences to win credit to their lawes, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> receives his from the goddeſſe <hi>Aegeria, Lycurgus</hi> his from <hi>Apollo.</hi> And how many have we now adayes (our Modern <hi>Enthuſiasts</hi>) that dream their Midiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh dreames, and then tell it for Goſpel to their neighbours (as wiſe as themſelves) leading men into the lyons mouth (that roaring lyon) under pretence of a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that old Impoſtour did the young Prophet. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>This we may be ſure of, that many illuſions have come in the likeneſſe of viſions; and abſurd fancies under pretence of raptures; and what ſome have called the ſpirit of Prophecy, hath been the ſpirit of lying; and contemplation hath been nothing but Melancholy and unnatural lengths; and ſtilneſſe of prayer hath been a meer dream and hypochondriacal devotion, and hath ended in pride or deſpair, or ſome ſottiſh and dangerous temptation.</p>

                        <p> Much like unto <hi>Heron</hi> the Monk, of whom it is reported, that having lived a retired and mortified life together for many years; at laſt the Devil taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the weakneſs of his Melancholy and unſetled ſpirit, gave him a tranſportan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an extaſie, in which he fancied himſelf to have attained ſo great perfection, that Angels would be his ſecurity (ſo dear he was to God) though he threw himſelf into the bottome of a well, he obeyed his fancy and temptation, did ſo, bruiſed himſelf to death, and died poſſeſſed with a perſwaſion of the verity of that extaſie and tranſportation.</p>
                        <p>It is more healthful and nutritive to dig the earth and eat of her fruits, than to ſtare upon the greateſt glories of the Heavens, and live upon the beams of the ſun: So, though all violencies and extravagancies of a religious fancy are not illuſions; yet, they are all unnatural, little ſecure, little reaſonable, little conſiſting with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and ſo unſatisfying to the ſoul; that they often diſtract the faculties, ſeldom advantage piety, and are full of danger in their greateſt luſtre.</p>

                        <p>Witchcraft in general ſignifyes all curious arts, wrought by the operation of the Devil. The ground is a league or compact with him; Either, 1. Open, when men invocate the Devil in expreſſe words, or otherwiſe make any manifeſt covenant with him. Or, 2. Secret, when men uſe means, which they know have no force, but by the operation of the Devil.</p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:52564:159"/>
                        <p> Of Witchcraft there are three kinds. 1. Superſtitious Divination, of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. Jugling, to work feats beyond the order of nature, as did the Magicians of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 3. Charming or inchanting, which is by the pronouncing of words, to procure ſpeedy hurt, or ſpeedy help.</p>
                        <p>A Witch is one, that wittingly and willingly uſeth the aſſiſtance of the Devil himſelf, for the revealing of ſecrets, working of ſome miſchief, or effecting of ſome ſtrange cure. There are indeed other ſuperſtitious perſons, who uſe charming, and by it do many cures, perſwading themſelves, that the words which they uſe have force in them, or that God hath given them to do ſtrange things: Such in a natural honeſty may deteſt all known ſociety with the Devil, and in that reſpect are not the Witches which the Scripture adjudgeth to death; yet are they at the next door to them, and are to be admoniſhed to relinquiſh their ſuperſtitious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: Becauſe, 1. The efficacy of things that comes by any other means than the ordinance of God, (which efficacy was either put into the thing in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or ſince by ſome new inſtitution in the Word,) is by Satanical operation. 2. Charms, Inchantments and Spells, have no force, unleſs we believe they can do us good; which faith is falſe, and the ſervice of the Devil; for we muſt believe, hope, do nothing, without, or againſt the Word of God.</p>
                        <p>To diſcover a Witch, is very hard; for they do their feats in cloſe manner; not only by ſoul and open curſing, but alſo by fair ſpeaking, and by praiſing of things. Nevertheleſs there are five ſpecial things for diſcovery: <hi>Viz.</hi>

They depart from God and his teſtimony, and ſo tempt the Devil to tempt them. And they which in caſe of Loſs, or Sickneſs, &amp;c. make Hell their refuge, ſhall ſmoke and ſmart for it in the end. Satan ſeeks to them in his temptations, they ſeek unto him in their conſultations; and now that they have mutually found each other, if ever they part, it is a miracle. He is an unſpeakable proud Spirit, and yet will ſtoop to the meaneſt man or woman to be at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; (The Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> is twice in one verſe called the Miſtreſs of the Spirit, becauſe in covenant with him,

Bithner.</note> I think becauſe men are uſually proud of their ſtrength: Any kind of ſtrength is apt to make men proud, ſtrength of purſe, ſtrength of parts, ſtrength of body, ſtrength of wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (which is the higheſt and nobleſt natural ſtrength;) yea, (ſo ſtrange are the ways and methods of temptation) the very ſtrength of grace or ſpiritual ſtrength hath blown up ſome with pride: For though humility properly flow from the ſtrength of grace, and the more grace, the more humility, yet upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the greatneſs and ſtrength of their graces, ſome have been proud and high-minded; that is, they have not lived in ſuch dependance on Chriſt as they ought.</p>
                        <p>Our ſtrength lies much in the ſenſe of our weakneſs, becauſe then we go out of our ſelves for ſtrength to Chriſt: whereas they who are ſtrong in themſelves, muſt needs be weak, becauſe the ſtrength of God goeth out againſt them.</p>
                        <p>There is no ſtrength of the creature that can protect it from the wrath of God.

                        <p>An argument from profit is very forcible, This was <hi>Hamans</hi> cozenage, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3.8. <hi>It is not for the Kings profit to ſuffer the Jews.</hi> Why are men ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſheep? becauſe they are profitable creatures. Why do men give ſo much money for an office? becauſe it is profitable, and bringeth great gains with it. Why do men ſtrive to make their ſons Lawyers? becauſe the Lawyers go away with all the profit. Godlineſſe of all things is moſt profitable; to procure us the peace of conſcience in this world, and to ſave us in the world to come.</p>
                        <p>Hope of profit will turn ſome ſpirits into any poſture. Some men will be in any action, ſo they may gain by it, they will mourn for hire, and curſe for hire; So did <hi>Balaam.</hi> When he was ſent for to curſe the people of God, <hi>Num.</hi> 22. He
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52564:163"/>made many delayes, and ſeemingly conſcientious ſcruples, yet at laſt goes about the work as black and bad as it was. What overcame him, and anſwered all doubts? <hi>He loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Nay, (which is the higheſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a mercinary ſpirit) ſome act holineſſe for hire, and are godly for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gain.</p>
                        <p>But ill gain in a little time becomes heavie to the conſcience, as heavie as <hi>Judas</hi> his thirty pieces. He ſed his thoughts with the hope of the money before he had it, and pleaſed his eye with it when he had it; but now in a few hours in the ſight of the money he ſees his ſin, the ſight of his hateful ſin works horror of conſcience, horror of conſcience brings in deſpair, deſpair cauſeth ſelf-murther.</p>
                        <p>Godlineſſe it ſelf is great gain, if we have no more; but godlineſſe brings in gain in abundance beſides it ſelf. Whatſoever drops out of any promiſe of the Goſpel, falls into the lap of a godly man. When the promiſes open at any time, and give forth their vertue, they muſt needs give it forth to him that is godly, for golineſſe hath the promiſes.

                              <item>1. The temptations of Satan are uſually to things againſt Nature, or againſt the God of Nature; as Blaſphemy, Self-murther, Sodomitry, &amp;c.</item>
                              <item>2. They are uſually ſudden and fierce, and violent like lightening; leaving not a man time for deliberation.</item>

                        <p>Again, the Deviltempts, 1.

                        <p>Satan uſually keeps his greateſt and moſt violent temptations unto the laſt. He tempts moſt at death. One coming to viſit a ſick friend, asked, <hi>Hath Satan been with you yet?</hi> The party anſwered, <hi>No:</hi> To whom the other replied, <hi>Look to it,

                        <p>But the ſorrow of the world, is that which carnal men conceive,
<note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon. fol. 1901.</note> either for the want or loſs of good, or for the ſenſe or fear of evil. Thus Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who died (as ſome ſuppoſed by her much ſighing before her death) of thought and ſorrow, either for the departure of King <hi>Philip,</hi> or the loſs of <hi>Calice,</hi> or both. Thus <hi>Nabal</hi> ſorrowed.</p>
                        <p>To theſe may be added a third; An helliſh ſorrow, a deſperate grief for ſin,
<note place="margin">Virtus nolenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um nulla est.</note> as was that of <hi>Judas.</hi> Fained or forced grief is nothing worth: He grieved, and yet miſcarried; It was ſqueezed out of him, as verjuice out of crabs. But <hi>Peter</hi> went forth to weep bitterly.</p>
                        <p>Gods people are commanded to afflict themſelves with voluntary ſorrow. Some ſhadow of it we have in <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the Theban General, who the next day after the Victory and Triumph, went drooping and hanging down his head: And being asked why he did ſo? He anſwered,

                        <p>The ſoundneſs and ſincerity of ſorrow is ſhewed by the ſecrecy of it.

                        <p>Sorrow is a breaker; It breaks no bones, but it breaks the heart. Worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row breaks the heart to death; Godly ſorrow breaks the heart to life.</p>
                        <p>Sorrow ſhortneth the ſpirit of man; that is, Sorrow over-acted, weakens the whole man, and leaves him unable to put himſelf forth in action. Joy is the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or widening of the heart; much joy makes the ſpirit free to act: So ſorrow is a ſtraitner of it, it makes a man narrow-hearted, and narrow-handed; it ſtops him in his actings, or ſtays him from acting.</p>
                        <p>We commonly ſay, <hi>Sorrow is dry:</hi> 'Tis ſo, becauſe it is a drier. <hi>A broken ſpirit drieth the bones,</hi> Pro. 17.22. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his book of <hi>Long and ſhort Life,</hi> aſſignes Grief for a chief cauſe of death.

                        <p>In Fevers we deſire to drink, and yet we will not; And ſo in Apoplexies to ſleep, and yet we will not. A mans hand is gangren'd; a Chyrurgeon comes to cut it off: The natural deſire ſhrinks and pulls back the hand, becauſe Nature ſeeks the preſervation of it ſelf; But the reaſonable deſire ſaith, rather than the whole body ſhall be conſumed, he will command the Chyrurgeon to cut off the hand. Here is no repugnancie betwixt the natural and reaſonable deſire, but a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination.</p>
                        <p>Again, A Martyr is carried to the ſtake to be burnt; the natural deſire ſhrinks, but yet it ſubmits it ſelf to the ſpiritual deſire, which cometh on and ſaith, Rather than diſhonor God, go to the fire and be burnt.</p>

Thus, one deſire being gone, another comes in place of it.</p>
                        <p>It is better to moderate Deſire at the firſt, than afterwards to preſcribe it a meaſure.</p>
                        <p>Let Deſire be converſant about right objects. He that pants after the duſt of the earth, ſhall always be indigent; crying continually (with the two daughters of the Horſe-leech) <hi>Give, give.</hi> But he that truly deſires after Righteouſneſs, ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>

                        <p>But ſome are as unwilling to meditate of Death, as a child to look into the dark: If they make their Will, they think they are nearer to it.

                        <p> Of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor it is ſtoried, That he was ſo hated for his Tyranny, that when he was dead, ſome of the people would have had him thrown into the river <hi>Tiber;</hi> ſome, hang'd up in an ignominious manner; others alſo made prayer to mother Earth, to grant him now dead, no place but among the wicked. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, when <hi>Dio</hi> died, the people of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> would have gladly redeemed his life with their own blood; which becauſe they could not, they buried him very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, in an eminent place of their city.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> of old, after the Funeral ſolemnities ended, (which were very many,) uſed to take their farewell of the dead body in theſe words; <hi>Vale, vale, vale: nos te ordine quo natura permiſerit ſequemur.</hi>

                        <p>To have a comely burial, is a great bleſſing. It was threatned upon <hi>Jehojakim</hi> the ſon of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> as a curſe, that he ſhould be buried with the burial of an Aſs, drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 22.19. It is like, that man had lived like a beaſt; and God threatens him by name, that when he died, he ſhould be uſed as a beaſt. True it is, they whoſe ſouls are with God in heaven,
<note place="margin">Facilis jactura ſepulchri.</note> may be without a burying place on earth; The bodies of many of the ſervants of God, have been, and may be ſcattered upon the face of the earth, like dung, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.2. Yet even then unto them, there is this bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, beyond the bleſſing of a burial, They are laid up in the heart of God, and he takes care of them; yea, He imbalms them for Immortality, when the remains of their Mortality are troden under foot, or rot upon a dunghill.</p>

                        <p>It was not poſſible that Chriſt ſhould be holden of death.
<note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> This impoſſibility ſprang chiefly from an utter inconſiſtencie with the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of God, to ſuffer a Perſon ſo innocent and holy as Chriſt was, and withall, having fully accompliſhed what he undertook by dying, to remain any longer in the bands and priſon of death. For, this act of raiſing of Chriſt, is to be looked upon as an act of righteouſneſs and equity, as well as of power.</p>
                        <p>Again, there was neceſſity for it on Gods part too, by way of deſign or wiſdom, <hi>viz.</hi> to accommodate the great end of glorifying himſelf, in the ſalvation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men. They that are ſaved, could not be ſaved (at leaſt on ſuch terms) without being juſtified: Juſtified they could not be, without believing: Believe they could not, but by and through the riſing again of Chriſt from the dead. Hence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. Thus the righteouſneſs and wiſdom which together ſhine forth in it, give as it were a gracious luſtre, and ſet off, to the Power that appeared in it.</p>

When a thing is made of nothing, as in the firſt Creation. 2. When a thing of evil is made good, as in Regeneration; <hi>Create in me a clean heart.</hi> 3. When the bodies ſhall be raiſed out of the duſt, at the Reſurrection. The firſt is called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>It is called Eternal Judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. Becauſe, 1. It is of things eternal, Eternal life, or eternal death. 2.

The perſons judged are eternal; ſome to enjoy eternal happineſs, and ſome to ſuffer eternal puniſhment. The Judgment it ſelf is not eternal, it laſteth not ever; but the fruit and event of it is eternal. Oh that the cogitation of this Judgment were deeply fixed in the hearts of us all!</p>

                        <p>If any ask, whether Hell were created of God? I anſwer, Conſider Hell as a place ſimply,<note place="margin">And it is very probable, that Angels falling, &amp; hell making was both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> it was created at firſt by God, when he diſtinguiſhed all places; but as it is Hell, a place of torment, it was not ſo by creation: Satan and mans ſin brought that name and uſe unto it; And thus <hi>Tophet</hi> may be ſaid to be prepared of old, as a puniſhment for ſin, and a place for juſtice to be inflicted upon ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God.</p>
                        <p>For the locality of Hell; all agree in this, that there is ſuch a place; only where that place of the damned ſhould be,<note place="margin">Omnia entia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita neceſſe eſt in aliquo ubi.</note> there are variety of opinions about it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> and his followers hold it is in the air, groundleſly grounding on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Iſidore</hi> (but nothing probable) will have it under the Globe of the earth. A third (confutable enough) in the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> from <hi>Joel</hi> 3.12. A fourth opinion (owned of many learned men, but without foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Word) is, that Hell is in the very center of the earth. Others with <hi>Keckerman,</hi> that Hell is in the bottome of the Sea, this they build upon that phraſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. c. 24.</note> This indeed ſeems to carry ſome ſhow of reaſon, but cannot be the ſenſe of the place.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that write with moſt ſobriety, ſay only in general, <hi>Gehennam eſſe locum ſubterranenm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The truth is, Scripture doth not relate the very particular place where Hell is, and perhaps it is concealed, to prevent curioſity in many, to keep faith in uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as alſo to rouze men from ſecurity, and to make them fearful of ſin in every place: yet there is warrant enough for the belief of two things in general. 1. That there is ſuch a place as Hell, that is, a place diſtinct from Heaven. 2. That this place wherever it is, it muſt be below Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Job</hi> 11.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.15. If any ſhould aske any farther, I anſwer in anothers words,<note place="margin">Vbi ſit, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent qui curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs quaerunt.</note> where it is, they ſhall find one day, who over-curiouſly enquire. At leaſt, I may ſay as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, I was never there my ſelf, nor ſpoke with any that came from thence.</p>
                        <p>Let us labour more to avoid Hell, than endeavour to find out the place where it is; elſe Hell (where-ever it is) will find us out. Though we know not the place for certain, yet we may certainly know this, that ſin is the very high road to Hell, and the direct way thither, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.26. And let us take heed of ſin in every place, ſeeing we know not where the particular place of Hell is. Hell follows ſin at the heels. If we ſin againſt God, God knows how near Hell we are. A guilty and galled
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52564:180"/>conſcience, joyned with a profane wicked life; is the lively picture of Hell it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Gebenuâ nihil grovius ſed ejus me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whereunto ſhall I liken her lovers? they are like to thieves, that go through a fair flowred meadow to the Gallows: they are like to rivers that run freſh and ſweet (or fiſhes ſporting) but fall into the ſalt Sea: Or like to travellers, laid along to ſleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade; but awaking, find themſelves ſcorched with the heat of the removed Sun. When they have ended and laviſh't all, at laſt comes conſcience and calls for a reckoning; then comes death, with a napkin on his ſleeve, and his trenclier-knife in his hand, and with his voyder takes all away. If the wrath of God once ſmoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, he will ſet all your ſins in order before your eyes; that though you turn your back, yet like furies they ſhall haunt you, and like the Ghoſt in <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> cry for revenge; they ſhall haunt you, and ſet no colour before you, but red and crimſon; yea, and throw bowles of blood upon your faces, never leaving you, till they have brought you from a dying life, to a violent and curſed death; like the poor fiſh, that feeling the heat of the water, thinks to mend her ſelf, and leaps into the fire.</p>
                        <p>Would not our hearts bleed within us, to ſee an army of men marching againſt the mouth of a Canon, to be wounded, diſcomfited; ſome groaning and crying out; ſome ſlain out-right, and cut off by the middle; ſome crawling on the ground, with their lungs peeping out through their ſides; ſome ſtooping with their bowels in their hands; ſome ſliced down their legs; ſome cloven down the chin; ſome their brains daſht out, and beſprinkled on the drumme: All theſe, and thouſands ſuch, are but as fleebitings, to that horrid ſlaughter, and horrible blood-ſhed of the damned in hell fire.</p>
                        <p>And when all is done we muſt dye. A grave onely remaines to receive us. Three cubits are allotted to us.<note place="margin">None telluris tres tantum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biti te expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant?</note> A little quantity of ground hath nature proportioned, though ſometime thou didſt poſſeſſe as much as ever the tempter ſhewed Chriſt. The remainder of mighty <hi>Hercules,</hi> will ſcarce fill a little pitcher. When certain Philoſophers intentively beheld the tom be of <hi>Alexander, Heri fecit ex aurò theſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52564:181"/>hodie aurum ex eo facit theſaurum;</hi> yeſterday the world did not content him, to day three cubits contain him. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> bragging of his lands, <hi>Socrates</hi> carried him to the Map of the world, and bid him demonſtrate them, but he could not find them, for alas, <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf was not diſcernable. This earth would ſerve the wicked ſtill; had they not better lye in rottenneſſe than combuſtion? were not a cold grave more welcome than a hot furnace? Now they beg not a city, though a little one, a <hi>Zoar;</hi> nor a houſe, though poor and bleak, as <hi>Codrus;</hi> nor an open aire, though ſharp and irkſome, ſcortched with the Indian ſun, or frozen with a Ruſſian cold; for of ſuch favours there is now no hope: Give them but a mountain to fall on them, or rock to hide them; and they are pleaſed. Here is a ſtrange alteration for the wicked, when they ſhall go from a glorious manſion, to a loathſom dungeon from a table of ſurfeit, to a table of vengeance; from fawning obſervants, to afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, from a bed of down, to a bed of fire, they that commanded all the earth, cannot now command a piece of earth to do them ſervice.</p>
                        <p>God will wound the hairy ſcalp of him that goeth ſtill in his wickedneſſe, there remaineth for impenitent ſinners, a worme that knaweth the conſcience; and there is prepared for the wicked a fire, which never goeth out; where is horrour, terrour, weeping, wailing, wringing of hands, gnaſhing of teeth, continual death, yet thoſe that are there never dye. <hi>Tantalus</hi> his Apples, <hi>Siſyphus</hi> his ſtone, and thoſe ravening Harpies whereof the Poets do ſpeak, are nothing in reſpect of thoſe torments, whereof the wicked ſhall taſt; unleſſe in this world they do repent, and caſt their accounts a freſh.</p>
                        <p>The pains of Hell (as a reverend father of the Church obſerves) make a four-fold impreſſion in the ſoules of men; 1. A carefull fear, that declineth them. 2. A doubtfull fear, that conflicteth them. 3. A deſperate fear, that ſhrinketh them. 4. A damned fear, that ſuffereth them.</p>
                        <p>Then the will ſhall be a hell in it ſelf; the memory ſhall be continually troubled with a fixed recordation of things paſſed, which it once poſſeſſed; the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be darkned, with innumerable waves of imaginations; the light ſhall be affirighted with ugly Devils and darkneſſe, the hearing, with odious and hideous out-cries; the ſmelling, with noiſome ſtinkes, the taſt, with raging thirſt, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing hunger; the feeling afflicted in every part with intollerable paines; in compariſon whereof, our earthly fires are no more but painted flames.</p>
                        <p>Depart from me, is a curſed condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> from my Quire of glorious Angels, from the communion of bleſſed Saints. <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Martyrs and Confeſſors: from me, from my holy hill: Well may the wretched ſoul (<hi>Eſau</hi> like) weep and howle.</p>
                        <p>To be ſecluded from the preſence of God, is of all miſeries the greateſt; in ſo much that a father on <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, Many do abhorre hell; but I eſteem the fall from that glory, to be a greater puniſhment than hell it ſelf. Better to endure ten thouſand thunderclaps, than be deptived of the beatifical viſion.</p>
                        <p>O the madneſſe of moſt; that will rather loſe God and Chriſt, and heaven and all, than loſe a luſt! <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> being forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render himſelf, his Army and his Kingdome into his enemies hands, for a draught of water; (they being all ready to die for thirſt) when he had drunk his water, he breaks out, O how ſhort a pleaſure is this, that for one draught of water, I have loſt a glorious Kingdome! Truly infinite greater cauſe will the damned have to complain of their loſſe.</p>
                        <p>Somethings do perfect a good feaſt; <hi>viz.</hi> Good company, good chear, good place and good time. But all thoſe good things are awanting,<note place="margin">Varro apud Gelljum.</note> at the black ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet in the nethermoſt hell: At other feaſts, the more the merrier; but that's a ſorry ſupper, where the more the more miſerable.</p>
                        <p>Oh! do not, do not run the hazard of theſe eternal torments, for enjoying the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon. He that playes the thief is a very fool; it may be, he may not be an hour in ſtealing the commodity, and yet he may lye a whole year in the Goal for it, and have hanging when all is done. But oh! how many greater fools are there than theſe; that will haply for an hours pleaſure, or at the moſt for
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52564:182"/>a lifes-time; lye in the Goal and priſon of hell, not for a year, but to all eternity? Suppoſe that by your unjuſt gain, you increaſe your eſtate, and get large revenews; if you loſe God, what get you? if you loſe a ſoul, what gain you? if you loſe Chriſt, what advantageth it you.</p>
                        <p>We read of a certain ſalt in <hi>Sicilia,</hi>

Certainly the fire into which the damned ſouls are caſt,<note place="margin">Cupient mori et mors fugit ab illis.</note> and tormented, is without all intermiſſion of time or puniſhment; They ſhall deſire to dy, and death ſhall ſhe from them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.6.</p>

The firſt Man was the firſt ordered Prieſt; who for his diſobedient diſorder in going beyond his Commiſſion, and violating the ſacred League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and him, was with ſhame enough degraded.

                     <p> Neither was this <hi>Adam's</hi> caſe alone; All mankind whoſe perſon and cauſe he did undergo, feel the ſmart of that extream loſs: This loſt the Prieſtly dignity, and that Covenant ceaſed by reaſon of tranſgreſſion: So that God was no more their God, their King; nor they his people, or a Kingdom of Prieſts to him. The Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ended; there being not any found in the whole world, of ability to diſcharge that function, according to the primitive obligation. The ſacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving failed; Man forgetting his due reſpects to his Infinite Creator. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation on the Name of God by devout Prayers proceeding from a pure heart, vaniſh'd, through the corruption wherewith the heart of man was miſerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. In fine, the gracious communication which was, and to be betwixt God and man, received a period, by <hi>Adam's</hi> ejection out of Paradiſe for his grand apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie.

                     <p>To hope for a change into a better, was but vain; unleſs God did open the bowels of his mercy, to recelve us into favour and enter into a new Covenant, (the former being aboliſh'd,) a Covenant of Grace: wherefore the Lord commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating our diſtreſs'd condition, did ſet his wiſdom on work to find out a way to free us from lamentable perplexities: To this purpoſe, a Mediator is appointed by our Judge himſelf to follicit him, as an Advocate for ſinners, whereby to make up the breach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> whoſe part was not (as the caſe then ſtood) to preſent an Euchariſtical ſacrifice for benefits conferr'd on mankind; nor an oblation of prayers for an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of them; but to offer up an Expiatory ſacrifice for the wrong God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and a ſufficient price for the impetration of our ſins remiſſion. To this end, another Prieſthood (as was neceſſary) was ordained in mercy; by the effectual execution whereof, ſin committed ſhould be expiated, and an acceſs made for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors unto the Throne of grace. And this is the Prieſthood only of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> who knew no ſin, and in whoſe mouth was found no guile; Being <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before this high Calling ſhould be actually executed by Chriſt in perſon, it was the will of our Heavenly Father, 1. That men ſhould be apprehenſive of the want thereof, by the conviction of conſcience of the multitude of ſins, and gravance of them. 2. That the minds of men ſhould be throughly toucht with a longing for it, are it came to the real performance; yet ſo, as that in the interpoſing time, their hopes might be ſupported againſt deſpair, that might ſpring out of the remorſe of conſcience for their ſins, which would not be taken away, but by that High-Prieſt which taketh away the ſins of the world: Hereupon a Typical Prieſthood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for a time, till the fulneſs of time, called <hi>the time of reformation, Heb.</hi> 9.10. determin'd by the moſt prudent Diſpenſer of times and ſeaſons, ſhould come: Men of infirmities and ſubject unto ſin, were then by the Law of a carnal precept appointed to offer up for the ſons of men, innocent beaſts; in whoſe death, by the effuſion of their blood wherein conſiſted their life, they did contemplate their own merit. Theſe creatures did not any thing worthy death, as was rightly conceived; neither could theſe Sacrifices cleanſe the Sacrificers from ſin to perfection, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the conſcience: This was underſtood; wherefore then, they could not but conclude, that being they did offer ſuch, they did but give to God under their hands and ſeals, an acknowledgment of their errors, and a confeſſion of a due debt. Yet ſeeing God was the Author of the inſtitution of them, and accepted them at their hands, as ſacrifices of a ſweet ſmelling favour; they conceived a lively hope of grace and pardon; framing with themſelves the like diſcourſe to that of <hi>Samſon's</hi> mother,<note place="margin">Judg. 13.23.</note> 
                        <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not receive a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands.</hi>

                        </note> Theſe Figures then being but the <hi>ſhadows of good things to come,</hi> not the very image of the things; did bear up their hopes, and in ſome meaſure eſtabliſh their confidence in him, by whom they expected good things to come. This is the ground of the Apoſtles reaſoning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. <hi>If the blood of bulls and goats ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> there's the ſhadow: <hi>how much more</hi> (ſee the ſubſtance) <hi>ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without spot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi>

                     <p> Here then I am to intreat of my Saviour's Prieſthood, whereby eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is obtained, that they who are called, may receive the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance: A Subject challenging moſt reverent devotion and care. Now that I may not rove from the Apoſtle's intended ſcope, Three things ſhould be handled:
<list>
                           <item>1. Of him, as he is a Prieſt befitting us; <hi>Such an High-Prieſt became us.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. Of his perſonal qualities, related in the concrete; <hi>Who is holy, harmleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. Of his dignity, to which he is advanced; <hi>Made higher than the heavens.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>How deep are all men in the guilt of ſin, all men enlightned with the knowledge of the truth, eaſily perceive; who, when brought to the acknowledgment of this, cannot be ſo ignorant, as not to know the depth of their miſery. The depth of their miſery, without the ſucceſsful Mediation of the Son of God, is their abiding under the wrath of God, which cometh upon the children of diſobedience. For the removal whereof, the Supreme Moderator that dwelleth in the Heavens, ruling all things, hath anointed his Son High-Prieſt, to deal in things concerning men: To whom, as he <hi>gave the nations for his inheritance,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. Pſal. 110.</note> and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion;</hi> ſo hath he <hi>confirmed him to be an High-Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec:</hi> From whom, by an heavenly decree, he expected the full diſcharge of the Prieſtly function impoſed upon him,<note place="margin">Sacerdos, q. Sacer dux.</note> the intent and purpoſe whereof was to bring men to God. And this being the act of Mercy, according to the good pleaſure of his will, willing to paſs by offences; his Juſtice, whoſe rigor is inflexible, ever loving righteouſneſs, and haring iniquity, ſteps in to claim ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: This muſt have been given for the ſins of the ſons of men, before they could have vouchſafed them any perfect hope of a gracious reconcilement. To join therefore Mercy and Juſtice together, whereby to end the difference; the Divine Wiſdom concluded, That the puniſhment due to ſin, ſhould be converted into an Expiatory ſacrifice; and this ſhould appeaſe and quiet the one, and make an eaſie way and entrance for the other. <hi>At quarendum Sacrificium,</hi> But ſuch a one was to be ſought for; and ſuch a one too as might be, <hi>&amp; Sacerdes &amp; Sacrificium,</hi> both Prieſt and Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Here was a work fit only for the ſcrutiny of the Sacred Trinity, infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the imagination of Man, though never ſo vaſt. All the Creatures could neither afford the one, nor the other: An Angel could not be Prieſt; Man muſt, to plead the cauſe of men with God. Neither could the Sacrifice for man be an Angel, becauſe it was not meet that the death of an Angel ſhould be the expiation of a crime perpetrated by man. Nay further, might it be ſo, we ſhould (I believe) be hardly induced to believe, that an Angelical oblation offered by that Spiritual nature, would profit us: The nature that offended, ought in all equity to purge away the offence, and to ſuffer for it.</p>
                     <p>Among Men therefore muſt the ſearch be made; but there was little hope to find out one that could, that would ſufficiently, effectually undergo ſo great a task: All were ſinners, terrified with the horrid guilt of their accuſing conſciences, and held captive in the chains of ſin, under the tyranny of the Prince of darkneſs: None of theſe durſt approach to preſent an offering unto God, who is pure Light; neither were any of them able, were any willing, to ſuſtain or endure the ſevere counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an angry God, before whom he was to appear. Yet a Man muſt have done the deed, if ever the deed were done: Hereupon it was agreed upon, that the Son of God, God over all bleſſed for ever, ſhould be made the Son of man, to be made the Saviour of man; the worlds Creator ſhould become one of the creatures of the world, to redeem the reſt; fram'd after the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, yet without ſin, to take away ſin:<note place="margin">Heb. 2.17, 18. <hi>Non ignara mali, miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>In all things it behoved him to be mâde like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people; who being tempted, might be able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to participate of the nature of Mankind by propagation, he was (as was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52564:185"/>requiſite) born of a Woman, an unſpotted Maid; whoſe womb was the ſeminary of our happineſs; according to the prediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head.</hi> And not to participate of Mans ſin, but to be <hi>Holineſs to the Lord;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Armin.</note> He was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Quo nativitas</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>qua erat ſupra naturam, ſed pro naturâ mirabili excellentiâ, naturam ſuperans, eandem virtute myſterii repararet:</hi> Whereby the Birth, which was above the ſphere of Natures activity, yet for nature ſurmounting Nature, through the excellence of a miracle, might repair the ſame by the unparallel'd virtue of an admired Myſtery.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Word was made fleſh;</hi> by whoſe powerful word, Fleſh and all things viſible and inviſible, in Heaven and Earth, were made. To him the Father of Heaven gave the order of Prieſthood; determining to have no other conſideration or price for the ranſom of tranſgreſſors, but his fleſh; His righteous ſoul poured out for them, ſhould ſave theirs. This was the reaſon why the Angel named him, by command from Heaven, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> At which reverend and holy Name, carrying in it an intimation of our Redemption, we <hi>the redeemed of the Lord,</hi> in remembrance of the benefit purchaſed for as by him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> with a religious lowlineſs ought to bow to him the ſoul, the body; for the Lord Jeſus hath bought both. So that I may juſtifie, with a forein Doctor, <hi>Quòd faelix videri culpa poſſit, quae talem meruit habere Redemptorem;</hi> That ſin may ſeem ſomwhat happy, that ſtood in need of, and obtained ſo prevalent, ſo worthy a Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>To make good what hitherto hath been ſaid of the Lords <hi>Meſſias,</hi> I muſt pitch my thoughts upon two points:
<list>
                           <item>1. Upon the manner of ordering <hi>Christ Jeſus</hi> our High-Prieſt.</item>
                           <item>2. Upon his efficacious execution of this office.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was ordered our High-Prieſt, by covenant, by oath. The firſt was uſual in the ordination of the Levitical Prieſts;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.5.</note> 
                        <hi>My covenant</hi> (ſaith the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy) was with Levi of life and peace.</hi> This other is peculiar to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Son of God, after the ſimilitude of <hi>Melchiſedeck's:</hi> For thoſe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were made without ſwearing of an oath; but this by an oath, by him that ſaid unto him, <hi>The Lord ſware, and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the covenant on Gods ſide with Chriſt Jeſus our High-Prieſt, there are two things: The demand of an act to be performed; and the promiſe of a liberal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration. The thing demanded of him, was the laying down of life, for the life of the world; a voluntary ſubmiſſion to the death of the Croſs, to free us from the croſs of the ſecond death. The thing promiſed upon performance, was, <hi>He ſhould ſee his ſeed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> he ſhould prolong his dayes, the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould prosper in his hand:</hi> He ſhould remain a Prieſt time out of mind; and that, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> that is, by the punctual exerciſe whereof, he ſhould be advanced to the Regal dignity.</p>
                     <p>The covenant again on our Saviours ſide with God, conſiſted alſo in other two things, anſwerable to the former: A free promiſe of yieldance to the demand of his Father, and the acceptation of the promiſed reward. See his reply, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Which done (being the ſhedding of his blood for the remiſſion of ſins) to the loweſt ſtep of humiliation and exact obedience; God did highly exalt him unto glory, to be <hi>King of righteouſneſs, and Prince of peace;<note place="margin">Mutus fit opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet qui non lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darit Herculem.</note> giving him a name, which is above every name, that at the name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Such was his heroick ſpirit, anointed with the oil of gladneſs above his fellows, that <hi>He endured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, for the joy that was ſet before him.</hi> Of this joy, we with others that believe in him, ſhall one day have an exuberant fruition; For to this very end, <hi>ſuch an High-Prieſt became us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Covenant of grace and peace, God addeth an Oath; which hath its uſe in this bleſſed Contract. It tends, 1. To the ratification of this Prieſthood, to make it ſure. 2. To the demonſtration of the immutability and dignity of it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Albeit no word of God coming from his mouth, can be taxt of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52564:185"/>leaſt inconſtancy; yet is he pleaſed to imitate men in their manner of contracting in matters of moment; 1. To raiſe up our weak hopes to a ſublime pitch of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in him. 2. That our High-Prieſt truſting to a double Anchor that cannot be removed, the one of Promiſe, the other of an Oath; might with an undaunted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſleight the reproach, and undergo the pain that was to befall him.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond; Gods oath exempts both this Prieſthood and the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from all immutability, containing in it a peremptory implicit decree for their eternity. <hi>Quicquid juramento confirmat Deus, id aeternum eſt &amp; immutabile;</hi> Whatever God confirms with an oath, is perpetual and unchangeable. The reaſon why the Lord did not eſtabliſh <hi>Levi's</hi> Prieſthood, and the firſt Covenant of Works, with the ſacred religion of a ſolemn oath, was, becauſe he intended it an alteration in time, to make the Lord Jeſus a Surety of a better Teſtament; not after the Law of a tarnal Commandement, but after the power of an endleſs life. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworne</hi> (ſaid <hi>Abrahams</hi> God to him) <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> This Seed is Chriſt, proceeding from him after many ſucceſſions of ages and generations; this Bleſſing is the Redemption of Man-kind by that ſeed, term'd the Son of Man in the execution of his Prieſtly Office; which is irrecoverable,<note place="margin">A Saviour <hi>in ſolidum.</hi>
                        </note> by which he is able to ſave them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him. <hi>Faelices nos quorum cauſà Deus jurare voluit, miſeros ſi ne juranti quidem credimus:</hi> Happy are we for whoſe ſakes God would ſwear; Moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy we, if when he ſwears we believe him not, but be diſobedient.</p>
                     <p>It makes alſo for the dignity and honour of this Prieſthood: 'tis of an higher eſtimation than that of <hi>Levi;</hi> for unto that were ſinners called; to this onely the moſt Holy, the Son of God. The ſacrifices of that, though many, and frequently iterated, purified not the conſcience, did not aboliſh treſpaſſes, merited not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bleſſings: But the Word of the Oath after the Law,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> did conſtitute Chriſt for ever a Prieſt, to purifie the conſcience, to aboliſh treſpaſſes, to merit celeſtial bleſſings; <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> As one therefore ſaid to <hi>David, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us;</hi> ſo we may ſay of Chriſt our High-Prieſt (becauſe God did ſwear) Thou art worth ten thouſand worlds of the other. <hi>And ſuch an High-Prieſt became us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much for the manner of Chriſts taking the holy order of Prieſthood, which was by Covenant, by Oath, both binders. His executing of this place, is in the next place to be conſidered, which (as the former) deſerves our moſt reverend regard.</p>
                     <p>Fidelity and aſſiduity both commend the undertakers of a weighty matter; and both are met in Chriſt, for the important work of our Redemption by grace; All his force was ever bent that way, to ruine our adverſaries, and raiſe us. In the adminiſtration of his Prieſtly office, he practiſed it, <hi>offerendo, intercedendo,</hi> by Sacriſicing, by Interceding; which were the two things that held moſt of that Order in continual imployment: He ſtood our friend without the leaſt flinching <hi>uſque ad aras,</hi> to the very death; when we ſtood in oppoſition to God, to him, to our ſelves. Before he preſented himſelf an Oblation to the Father of Spirits, he prepared himſelf for it, by a moſt ſubmiſſive humiliation, a moſt ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by moſt zealous ſupplications, and a moſt exquiſite ſenſe of humane infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; all which out-ſtretch the limits of all thoughts of man. He ſuffered the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that glory which he had with the Father before the world was, for a time to ſuffer an eclipſe; <hi>He was without form and comelineſs, and when men ſaw him,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.2.</note> there was no beauty that they ſhould deſire him.</hi> His entertainment in the world was but diſcourteous and poor: At his firſt entrance he was laid in a manger; and after, though he was Lord of Heaven and earth, yet had be not whereon to lay his head: Neceſſity forc'd him to fly, and oft to hide himſelf, (becauſe his hour was not yet come) to ſave his life: Uncivil language, ſlanderous reports, extream indignities were heapt upon him; Theſe were the ſeveral ſtiles wherewith the wicked world was pleaſed to honour him, A <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a Glutton, a Wine-bibber, a Seducer, a Traitor, a Friend to Publicans &amp; ſinners, a Devil, at leaſt one poſſeſt of a Devil: yet all this made him not tread one ſtep awry from the hallowed paths of a filial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52564:186"/>for notwithſtanding he was a Son,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.8. <hi>Schola crucis, ſchola lucis.</hi>
                        </note> yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered. He ſuffered the firſt part of his Paſſion in a Garden, for ſin, where ſin was firſt committed; where he offered up prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; with ſtrong crying and tears, to him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard, in that he was raiſed up by the unreſiſted power of his Almighty working. Soon after was he betrayed, apprehended, bound and forſaken: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, to expiate our treaſon in <hi>Adam;</hi> Apprehended, to reſtore us Captives unto liberty; Bound, to diſſolve the chains of our ſins; Forſaken, to perform the work of ſatisfaction and redemption all alone by himſelf. He was arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, whipped, and crowned with thorns: Arraigned, by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> He ſtood there for both their ſakes, to exempt them from the Tribunal of the Judge of all the world; Condemned, to juſtifie us in the ſight of God, by his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable innocence; Whipped, to deliver us from the ſpiritual, corporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſcourge which we deſerved; Crowned with thorns, to 1. Signifie his pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God, for our ambition in <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. His meriting for us an eternal crown. 3. His collecting a Kingly people out of the moſt thorny and burtful nations, which as a crown ſhould compaſs God about, in ſerving and honoring of him. 4. His bearing of our thorny cares, that we might quietly repoſe our truſt in him. He was clothed with a Purple garment, and in his hand was there put a Reed; both inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating he was a King, though both done in deriſion:<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.</note> The firſt ſhews he was that Warriour foreſpoken by the Prophet, <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom with red garments?</hi> The other, that he was he that ſhould break the Serpents head: For 'tis the obſervation of ſome learned, that a Reed is moſt mortal to a Serpent, and therewith were men uſed to kill them. Beſides, that by it as by a Pen, he did obliterate the hand-writing in the Lords Debt-book that was againſt us. He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and naked too; in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of dead mens bones, where malefactors ſuffered; to raiſe up the banner of righteouſneſs and ſalvation, even in the place of death and condemnation: But he ſuffered there naked too, to ſatisfie for our firſt parents tranſgreſſion, who were ſpoiled of the garment of Innocency; and perhaps to ſhew how we ſhould enter into Heaven, as <hi>Adam</hi> into Paradiſe, naked in body, but clad in ſoul, with innocency, with immortality: In a word, 'twas to expiate our ſhameful nakedneſs, to which our firſt ſin expoſed us. And this is the naked truth of the Truth.</p>
                     <p>This done, all was not done for which Chriſt came into the world; for 'twas but preambulatory to a greater work enſuing, what was hitherto done; for hereby was he compleatly ſitted to give himſelf for us, <hi>an offering and a ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> There did therefore ſucceed this, 1. The offering up of his Body, by the effuſion of his precious Blood, upon the high Altar of the Croſs, where he ſuffered the loſs of his life, the price of our Redemption; without blood there being no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. View him there, and he is juſt as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did deſcribe him,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>A man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief.</hi> Here he was lifted up, to anſwer the elevation of the Sacrifices of the Old Law, all types of him: <hi>Iſaac</hi> repreſented him <hi>in umbra,</hi> in the ſhadow, when the ſubſtance followed even in this point; ſo did the Braſen Serpent; they are the words of our Saviour, <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs,<note place="margin">There it was, <hi>Vide &amp; vive:</hi> here, <hi>Crede &amp; vive.</hi>
                           </note> even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> Joh. 3.14. He was lifted up in the air, that he might overcome the Prince of the air, and the <hi>Spiritual wickedneſſes in high places,</hi> triumphing over them in it: He was lifted up in the air to hang on a tree; that as death by a tree entred into the world, ſo on a tree it ſhould be deſtroyed, and life brought back again; and beſides, that he might <hi>bear the curſe of the Law,<note place="margin">Col. 2.15.</note> being made a curſe for us,</hi> according as the Apoſtle writes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being thus lifted up, in the very gall of bitterneſs, there was given him gall and vinegar to drink his laſt; that ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> might bear the puniſhment of the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> offence, in taſting the juice of the forbidden fruit. Neither did the malice of men fix it ſelf here, till they fixed both his hands and his feet to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52564:186"/>Croſs with nails; which aſſures us of the blotting out of the <hi>hand-writing of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that was againſt us,</hi> both of the diſſolution of all Ceremonial pactions, and of the full cancelling of the Bond Moral, for ſo much as concerns the forfeiting that lay upon us. This did not ſatiate their curſed humours,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> but a ſpear muſt be thruſt through his ſide; that we might find an open paſſage to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for our ſelves, cleanſed with his blood, that cleanſeth from all ſin; and waſht away with the water of Regeneration, flowing from him as from a bottomleſs Fountain of eternal life.

This much I know, that there have been four wayes of making man; One was the making man without either man or woman, ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> made; the ſecond was to make man without a woman, ſo was <hi>Eve</hi> made; the third was to make man both by man and woman, ſo we their poſterity are made; the laſt way was to make man without man by woman only, and ſo was Chriſt made man; who notwithſtanding was not polluted by being in the Virgins womb, no more than the Sun in the firmament receives infection from any place it ſhines upon here below.</p>
                     <p>From this tranſcendent purity of our High-Prieſts conception and birth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is harmleſſe; there is aforded us a double comfort; 1. By it, the faithful are juſtified from the unholineſſe of their impure conceptions,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tales nos amat Deus, quales fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi ſumus ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us dono; non quales ſumius no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro meritro. Concil. Arauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. ſecund. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> 12.</note> and from the guilt of original ſin. 2. They are confirmed in the joyful expectation of a perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: he that was ſo careful to have his natural body ſo exquiſitely fitted, will not certainly neglect his Myſtical body the Church, <hi>being bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> but will ſanctifie and cleanſe it, that he may preſent it to himſelf a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, not having ſpot or wricnkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be <hi>holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5.26, 27. Therefore to make us ſo, <hi>ſuch an High-Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As our High-Prie.ſt was thus in his original innocent; ſo was he in the whole courſe of his life undefiled. Men and Devils did indeed conſpire to bring him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their compaſſe, but could not prevail; their guilded Pills of corruption, plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fleſh and blood, could not be ſwallowed down of him; his unblemiſht foul was of a purer condition, than that it ſhould be infected by thoſe foul ſpirits: The Maſter of Sentences gives a double reaſon for it,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Wherefore the holineſſe of our gracious Mediatour is ſuch, as being God and man inſeperably; that he could not poſſibly be defiled by actual ſin: The Apoſtle ſaith directly, <hi>that he knew no ſin;</hi> that is, experimentally in his own perſon; he is called <hi>a Lamb undefiled and without ſpot; Pilate,</hi> that gave him over into the hands of ſinners to be crucified, ingeniouſly confeſt, <hi>he could find no fault in him at all;</hi> that good thief (as a father calls him) that was crucified with Chriſt, made a good confeſſion, when he ſaid, <hi>We receive a due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiſſe;</hi> hence there is added to his ſacred name the title of [<hi>righteous</hi>] <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 2.1.</note> for the end why he came into the world, was <hi>to fulfil all righteouſneſſe,</hi> thereby <hi>to ſave ſinners: Qui caeteros ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos faceret, debuit ibſe peccato &amp; vitio carere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Augustine.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>This actual righteouſneſs void of all tincture of evil, was not only for himſelf, but was efficacious for us; for as many as believe in him to the end of the world; for <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 10.4.

                     <p>For our better aſsurance of our High-Prieſts original and actual righteouſneſs, whereby he was harmleſs and undefiled; he was, being planted in a noble height, <hi>ſeperate from ſinners;</hi> not but that he did communicate of the ſame common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with all men, but not of their guilt, which is a neceſſary conſequent of the violation of the heavenly law; <hi>for where there is no tranſgreſſion, there is no guilt,</hi> which is a binding over the offendor to receive a deſerved puiſhment: 'Tis true,<note place="margin">One of thoſe natural notions the Devil could never blot out of mans mind. <gap reason="foreign">

As he could not give a ſufficient ranſome for the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of mankind, by the ſacrificing of himſelf, were he conſcious of thoſe crimes,

Wherefore to remove all rubs out of the way, that might hinder his faithful execution of the Prieſtly function, in all its parts; and that there might no queſtion be made of an abſolute impetration and procurement of ſalvation: to be confer'd upon as many as do beleave in him, and obey him; to the end he was as in reſpect of ſin, ſo in reſpect of guilt, ſeperate from ſinners.</p>
                     <p>This ſeperation was not local, or in regard of place; he dwelt among us, and came to call ſinners to repentance, but vertuall, in relation to his unſtained condition, and thoſe divine qualities where with be was replemiſht, and whereof ſinful men during their abode in the fleſh, are altogether uncapable: By this means all his moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done in obedience to the ſupream authority, which were infallible tokens of his inwrad pureneſs, were meritorious for us: Such is their unparalell'd worth, that though them, for the Authors lake, the father is become propitions unto men: Inſomuch, as for our everlaſting comfort I may ſpeak it.

For as many ſaviours were ſent from God to ſave the Iſraelites from bodily oppreſſion, ſo was Chriſt from his Father to eaſe us of the unſupportable burden of our inquities, wherewith we were heavily laden; As the Prophet was ſent with a bunch of figs, Phyſician-like, to cure <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> malady,<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.</note> ſo was Chriſt with the comfortable oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ever bleſſed Spirit, to mollify our bruiſes, to cloſe our wounds, to cleanſe

As <hi>Jonas</hi> was the Lords meſſenger of <hi>Ninevies</hi> ſalvation, if they did repent, though condemned; So Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant, is Gods meſſenger of eternal ſalvation to mankind condemned for ſin, if we believe in him. All which the Angels knowing, and men obtaining; the Angels ſung, and men may proſecute what they have begun; <hi>Glory be to God on high:</hi> If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not glory to the higheſt for this unparallel'd and incomparable love of his, we may be juſtly cenſured for ingrateful miſcreants, and for ever debar'd of the grace of God; and deſervedly ſhut out of the Court of heaven.

                     <p>Admire, 1. <hi>Gods infinite wiſdom;</hi> who could find out a means to work our ſalvation, when men and Angels ſaw none: it came not into the apprehenſion of mans ſhallow brain, to contrive how poſſibly an infinite ſatisfaction due to God by man,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.8.</note> could by man be given unto the infinite juſtice of God.

For, ſaith <hi>Anſelm,</hi> God was made man, that both he which had ſinned might ſatisfie, and he which was infinite might pay an infinite price.</p>

Others may admire our Creation, but let us admire our Redemption; though both acts of infinite power. It is admirable that our fleſh and our bones were formed of God, but yet 'tis more admirable that God would become fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones: It is a myſtery out-reaching our capacities, wherein is contained the greateſt ſublimity and the greateſt humlity, the greateſt power, and the greateſt infirmity, the greateſt majeſty, and the greateſt frailty. What is higher than God, lower than man? more powerfull than God, weaker than man? more glorious than God, more frail than man? Yet God by his alſufficient omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency hath conjoyned them together, that we might be conjoyn'd to God for ever.</p>

                     <p>Being then upon the point of honour, I muſt fixe upon thoſe two points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this honour doth conſiſt; which are,
<list>
                           <item>1. Obedience, not fained, but real.</item>
                           <item>2. Divine worſhip or adoration of him.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, becauſe God hath ſent a Saviour into the world, to viſit us his people from on high, and to redeem us from below the nethermoſt hell; we are to render all ſincere obedience to him: Our creation, our preſervation do both plead for, and challenge it at our hands, a regular conformity to his will, for <hi>we are his people, and the ſheep of his paſture;</hi> but much more our redemption, the end whereof is, <hi>that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear,<note place="margin">Luke 1.74, 75.</note> in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him, all the dayes of our life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This obedience is, 1. Internal, wrought and ſeated in the heart. 2. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, profeſt and made conſpicuous by outward expreſſions. For the former, it is internal, wrought in the heart; for the outward motions of our ſervice and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to God, have their proper dependance upon the good operations of the heart, as it is affected, moved and ruled by the Spirit of grace. In nature the heart is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> the firſt part in man that lives, and communicates natural life and motion to the reſt: So in grace, the heart is the very firſt that receives new life from above, according unto which all the other parts become inſtruments of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Gods glory, from being inſtruments of ſin and Gods diſhonour. The heart then once ſubdued to the obedience of God, the rebellion of our nature being ſuppreſſed, and the love of God ſhed abroad in them by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us; there is by the effectual working of the power of the moſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52564:193"/>High, begotten in us an ardent love of God, which is that ſpiritual flame of pure heavenly fire, that makes us zealous of good works, that actuates the whole man in piety, putting us awork in the ſerious diſquiſition of the affairs of heaven, and making us fiery hot in the Chriſtian purſuit of Gods glory and our eternal quiet. The Apoſtle defines it to be the fulfilling of the Law, ſo that upon it depends our obedience, there being no obedience without it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to conclude this with S. <hi>Bernard</hi> on the <hi>Canticles: Dilexit nos Deus dulciter, ſapienter, fortiter: dulciter, quia carnem induit; ſapienter,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> quia culpam cavit; fortiter, quia mortem ſuſtinuit: Sic nos diligamus Deum, dulciter ne il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecti, ſapienter ne decepti, fortiter ne compreſſi, deficiamus.</hi> God loved us ſweetly, wiſely, ſirmly: Sweetly, becauſe he aſſumed our nature; wiſely, becauſe he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchewed and declined our ſin; firmly, becauſe he ſuſtained death for us: In like manner, let us love God ſweetly, leſt allured; wiſely, left intrapped; and firmly, leſt conſtrained and fore urged, we revolt and apoſtatize from him. Let our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then be once heartily endeared unto him as they ought to be, and the whole world ſhall not remove our ſtanding, nor make us forſake our obedience due to God.</p>
                     <p>For the latter; This honour conſiſting in obedience, as it is internal, wrought in the heart, and ſeated there by love; ſo it is external, profeſt by outward expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It muſt not be lockt up in perpetual ſilence, nor buried in endleſs obſcurity; but our lips muſt be open to ſhew forth his praiſes, and our light muſt ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they ſeeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>This honorable obedience is expreſt two ways,
<list>
                           <item>1. By good language.</item>
                           <item>2. By good actions.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt it is expreſt by good language. The heavenly hoſt of Angels be aſſembled together to give the good time of the early day to the Son of God, now made the Son of Man: Sing and rejoice, not only becauſe the vacant places of Apoſtate Angels were to be filled up and ſupplied with the redeemed <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; but alſo becauſe we are by his moſt happy Incarnation made moſt happily the ſons of God, of the ſons of wrath; and partakers of their happineſs, of being partakers of great miſery. Wherefore joy was proclaimed from Heaven in the ſweeteſt dialects, by the Divine Heralds of Honor, becauſe the Author and Giver of Joy was come then into the world, which was the beſt day that e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Joy again is commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe enmity betwixt God and man (the juſt cauſe of ſorrow) is removed. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, Glory in the higheſt degree and largeſt extent is to be rendred unto God; which our firſt Parents by their unlawful tranſgreſſion would have taken away. And if the Angels thus ſing and rejoice, how much more are we engaged in the performance of the like, ſince he took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the nature of Man? ſince unto us that Child was born, and for us that Son was given? Sing and fear not then, as the Angels ſaid, becauſe he was born who hath taken away all cauſe of fear.

He rejoiced when he ſaw the Lord in an humane ſhape aſſumed for a time, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him: what ſhould we do now, that Chriſt hath coupied unto himſelf our nature by an everlaſting covenant and inviolable union? Our ſouls ought to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord our God, and our ſpirits to rejoice in God our Saviour. A new ſong is expected of us, being the old things are paſſed, and all things become new. With the Heavens ought we in a more ſpecial manner to declare the glory of the God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52564:194"/>of Heaven, and ſound forth in the choifeſt language and with moſt chearful heart, from generation to generation, the everlaſting praiſes of our God, for the wondrous work of our Redemption. God commands us, Good Angels invite us, all things prompt us to make our tongues as pens of ready writers, to ſet forth that good matter is indited in and by our hearts concerning the King of Kings;<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> whereby we may make his name to be remembred in all ages, and the people to praiſe him for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This honorable obedience is expreſt by good actions. To ſpeak well, and do ill, is <hi>ſimulata ſanctitas,</hi> counterfeit ſanctity; deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being that the true Light is gone into the world from the Father of Lights, who dwelleth in that Light which is unacceſſible; We who are the Children of Light by profeſſion, ought not to be imployed in the works of Darkneſs by diſſimulation. Our behaviour and converſation muſt be candid and unſtain'd, if our ſouls have received the true ſtamp and character of goodneſs: For this purpoſe God gave Chriſt, and Chriſt gave himſelf, <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works. Enoch</hi> walked with God; and <hi>Abraham</hi> pleaſed God; <hi>David</hi> did run the pure path of Gods commandments; and <hi>Christ</hi> did all things well. We are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all the divine ordinances of the God of Truth, that in none (if it be poſſible) we may be ſound faulty. <hi>Forſake evil, and do good,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet;) and ſo the Lord ſhall crown our deſires above what we are able to ask or think, ſaith the Apoſtle. Let your Covetouſneſs be turned to Liberality, that the Saints of God, thoſe of the houſhold of faith, may be the better for you: Let your Ambition be turn'd to Humility, that ye think not of your ſelves above that which is meet: Let your Adulteries be turn'd to Chaſtity, that your bodies may be fit temples for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in: Let your Idolatries and Superſtitions be turn'd to the zealous and Primitive ſervice of God, that God may dwell in the midſt of you: Let your Wantonneſs in attires and habits be turn'd to Gravity, whereby the Heavenly graces of the Eternal Spirit may be enlarged in you, and manifeſted by you, as becometh Saints: Let your hideous Blaſphemies and horrid Oaths be turn'd to a reverent naming of the Lord, that his Name may be hallowed by you. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, let all the Intemperance, Prophaneneſs, and Corruptions of our lives, be turned to Holineſs; whereby all our actions may favour of grace, goodneſs and obedience.</p>

                     <p>Thus much concerning the honour of Obedience, which this <hi>Glory</hi> in the Text imports. Now follows the other honour imported by it, which is the honour of Divine worſhip or adoration; whereof there are two degrees:

                     <p>The firſt is the internal affection or ſerviceable ſubmiſſion, which is as the ſoul or life: The other is the external note or ſign of ſuch ſubmiſſion, (as bowing, kneeling, ſupplication) theſe are the body or material parts of it. Now this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when divine, and oppoſed unto civil, is proper unto God, and incommunicable to any creature: For the glorious prerogative of our Creation and Redemption, in theſe works he admits no inſtrumental ſervice, much leſs can brook a Partner in the glory redounding to them; <hi>My glory will I not give unto another.</hi>

Bowing the body and kneeling, as uſed to expreſs a religious and divine worſhip, muſt not be directed to honour them which are no gods; but the <hi>Only wiſe and Immortal King.</hi> Never had any man juſter occaſion to worſhip an Angel, than S. <hi>John;</hi> or a Saint, than <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company had. The reaſon why the Lord in wiſdom would have as well their willingneſs to worſhip, as the Angel's and S. <hi>Peter's</hi> unwillingneſs to accept their proffered ſubmiſſion, ſo expreſly regiſtred, was, to imprint the true meaning of that Law in the hearts of all that ſhould read thoſe ſtories, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>

                     <p>From the time of Mans capital apoſtaſie effected by the cunning project of the ſubtile Serpent, all the creatures of God were at odds with Man, affected with recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal enmity. The fiery Dragon had ſet the world on fire; Combuſtion and Confuſion, the two extremities of diſtempered Paſſion, came on after. Hence by reaſon of the perpetual oppoſition of the creatures, Iniquity did abound, and the love of many wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cold. The burden of theſe diſturbances was ſo ponderous, that all things did groan under it: So many bluſtering ſtorms did ſucceed one upon the neck of another, as that the world ſeemed to deſpair of peace. Mans wicked diſobedience was taken ſo ill at Gods hands, (as well he might) as that he was incenſed againſt him and his poſterity, and for their ſake curſed the earth. Here then we find Man in hoſtility with God, with himſelf, with his brethren, with all Gods creatures both in heaven and in earth: So that he is excluded felicity, whereof he was before poſſeſſed; inviron'd with that deplorable miſery, which he then could not, and we now cannot without Chriſt Jeſus avoid. His rebellion againſt God, cauſed the creatures to rebell againſt him: He neglecting his Creator, is both by the Creator and creature neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: His falling from the Lord, made the Lord and the ſervants fall out with him. Becauſe the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch aſpiring minds, as to ſeek after that which is proper unto God; Peace is therefore departed from the ſons of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now there was no peace within, none without; until the Prince of peace, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by grace, put a period to the mutinous diſpoſition of ill-affected humors; until he had ſo ſalved the matter betwixt God and us, as that all things might work together for the good of us that are the elect of God.</p>

                     <p>In a peaceable Commonwealth all things flouriſh; men do plentifully enjoy themſelves, and plenty of all things, without interruption: whereas the diſcord and diſſentions of factious Licentiates by rebellion againſt their Prince, lays a gap open for ruine to enter upon them. So when upon our addreſs to God, we have obtained a peaceable condition; when we have laid down our arms or weapons, intending no more to ſight againſt Heaven; when the Mediator of the New Teſtament, by interpoſing himſelf betwixt God and us, hath concluded an everlaſting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable peace; then, then in very deed, no good thing will be denied us; <hi>There is no want to them that fear him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> This is moſt true: For by this peace we are adopted the ſons of God and heirs of glory; whereby there is conveyed unto us by the eternal conſtitution of the Poſſeſſor of all things, a juſt title to all things, to bleſſings both temporal and eternal; the treaſures of his graces are conferred upon us, the ſtorehouſe of his riches is ever open to us, and the pure crown of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and royal diadem of glory is laid up for us; For us who ſhall <hi>depart in peace according to Gods word, and whoſe eyes ſhall ſee his ſalvation.</hi>

                     <p>And thus much concerning the firſt peace wrought for Believers by Chriſts coming into the world, <hi>The peace of Reconciliation unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond peace which the God of peace grants us by our Saviours coming in the fleſh, is peace with our ſelves, called <hi>The peace of a good Conſcience.</hi> For, ſin that did at firſt put God and us at variance, continues in the children of wrath not yet reconciled to God, a perpetual diſquiet; Their conſcience finding no reſt, brings in deſpair and ruine. But the apprehenſion of Gods favour, and ſenſe of reconciliation by Chriſt, calms the conſcience of the child of God, and ſtops the paſſage to deſpair and ruine. The ground of this peace is Juſtification, whereby we have peace with God. Condemnation is a terror to the heart, and the thought of it able to ſhake the very foundations of the ſoul: But when a man by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit finds himſelf to be in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, having his conſcience waſht in his blood from the guilt of ſin, and the ſaving benefits of his unvalued Paſſion attributed unto him; then he takes his reſt; no turbulent paſſion ſhall diſturb his quiet condition, but will lay him down in peace, and dwell for ever in ſafety. This leavenly tranquillity of the Chriſtian heart is excited and effected in us, by Gods Spirit rightly informing our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of the glad tidings of peace, and aſſuring us of the adoption of ſons, by the remiſſion of all our ſins.
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note> Hence it is called, <hi>The peace of God that paſſeth all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52564:197"/>underſtanding.</hi> The peace of God, 1. Becauſe none can confer it upon us but God alone; it is his proper gift, and his alone work: <hi>My peace I give unto you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14.</note> ſaith our Saviour. 2. Becauſe it is not carnal nor humane, but divine; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in external matters, but in the heart, the mind, the conſcience, and Gods graces in them, which are all internal. Again, it is ſaid to paſs all underſtanding, that is, all created underſtanding; becauſe that no created underſtanding can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, no, not conceive it, if it be deſtitute of the Spirit of Chriſt, if it receive no Divine ſpiritual illumination from above. No wonder then, that being it is <hi>ens tranſcendens,</hi> of a tranſcendent nature, it is hid from the world: I aſſure you it is out of the ſphere of the worlds activity, and too too remote from the compaſs of worldlings capacity: 'Tis a ſecret which the glimmering light of nature cannot diſcover, but is made apparent in Converts, and to Converts, by the refulgent rays of the Spirit of grace. I will briefly deſcribe it, for better ſatisfaction, from the Agents and operations, or effects of it in man.</p>
                     <p>From the Agents. Then is the Conſcience truly poſſeſt of peace, ſaith one, <hi>Quando caro animo judici regitur, &amp; animus Deo praeſidi gubernatur:</hi> when the Mind as Judge ruleth the fleſh; and when God as Preſident or chief Ruler, ruleth the mind. God ruling the mind, and the mind the fleſh, cometh to work this peace in man: For the Conſcience, by the perfect operation of God, and the good mind, is as the Apoſtle ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

For it is not poſſible that that conſcience which is purified with the blood of Chriſt, and wholly practiſed in the works of Gods commandments, can be cuſtomarily ſubject to the infeſtuous diſtractions of a troubled ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>From the operations or effects of it in man. The peace of conſcience produceth in a Chriſtian theſe four things: <hi>Viz.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This peace maketh us confident in going to the Throne of grace, of obtaining our requeſts, and fearleſs of the aſſaults of <hi>our</hi> greateſt adverſaries. 'Tis the wiſe mans judgment of the righteous man, that <hi>he is as bold as a lyon;</hi> and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is never without peace; where righteouſneſs and peace kiſſing each other at their joyful meeting, augments and ſtrengthens the confidence of the juſt man. No power ſhall block up his paſſage, but upon all urgent occaſions he will unto his God: Sin, the greateſt impediment bringing ſhame and confuſion, is quite removed from reigning in him, and the guilt thereof taken away from condemning of him: Satan, the principal and malicious tempter, is troden under foot, the world is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the ſtrong-holds of Satan demoliſhed; ſo that no perplexed evils ſhall alter his reſolutions in the ways of holineſs, or make him falter in the ſolemn ſervices of God.</p>
                     <p>This peace ſecures us. He that keeps within diſtance of his enemies reach, and lies open without good guard, may find that his enemies malice and revenge ſtraight take the advantage and ply their parts; making the Act tragical, and the Scene bloody. But that man that is at peace with God and himſelf, may ſtand upon terms of greateſt defiance againſt his oppoſites: For as he comes not within the liſt of their reach, nor is deſtitute of ſafeſt protection; ſo neither can their malice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful minds gain the leaſt advantage againſt him; for their greateſt power is ever curbed by the awful power of the Omnipotent. What can Satan do? what can ſin? what can the world? They may thwart us, and that's all;
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7. <hi>Sat mediis tranquillus</hi>

                     <p>The third work of this peace, is Chriſtian liberty. Liberty from the yoke of the Moral law; and that in a double regard: In regard of the perfect fulfilling of the Law; an exact obedience without any error or obliquity, is not of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but to be proportion'd according to the meaſure of grace, which he that accepts the will for the deed gives unto us.
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.36.</note> For <hi>Chriſt hath freed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us. If the Son make you free, ye ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> And liberty from the bondage of ſin: <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. But he that hath the peace of a good conſcience, is not in ſubjection to the dominion of ſin, but is ſervant to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having obtained the liberty proper to the ſons of God, to which he is called. Liberty from the burden of humane traditions and ſuperſtitious inventions of men, either crept into the Church through the ſubtilty of Satan, or neglect of the Paſtors; or impiouſly impoſed by the Antichriſtian Hierarchy, under the ſhew of piety and Religion.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note>

The conſcience of a man rightly informed and guided by diſcretion, is apt to undertake all that may make for Gods glory, the Churches good, and his own ſalvation. <hi>Fear not little flock, it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you a kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt effect of this peace, is Joy; and it is called <hi>Joy unspeakable in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſuch an exceſs of joy, as we want utterance to expreſs it. <hi>A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> that is, a pacified conſcience, ſaith <hi>Solomon, is a continual feast;</hi> it frollicks and merries the heart in the very preaſe of adverſity; it encourages a man to ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of ſpirit, and a certain hope of victory; and it admits no bitter invective to be caſt out againſt us to deject us, nor produceth any clamorous accuſation to ruine us:

<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.21.</note> ſaith my God, unto the wicked.</hi> For their conſciences tell them that the Lord hath a quarrel unto them for their ſins; they ſee their condemnation printed in their ſoul, as it were with red letters in an Almanack. How can it be otherwiſe?

Seeing then that Chriſt brought it, preacht it, gives it, commands it; I ſhall therefore briefly preſſe it.</p>
                     <p>This kind of peace is twofold, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical. As Religion is the King upon which the Government of the Political State depends and moves; ſo Peace is the Raile that keeps both cloſe together. Truth hath aver'd it, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Cities and houſes, divided againſt themſelves, cannot ſtand. Factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the Commonwealth, and ſchiſmatical hot-brains in the Church, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diviſions, lay a gap open for deſtruction to enter in by.

                        <hi>to ſtudy to be quiet, and to be at peace among your ſelves.</hi> We muſt not let looſe the raines to precipitate paſſion, or let flie diſtaſtful language, unbeſeeming the profeſſors of the Goſpel of Chriſt; but ever by a ſanctified diſcretion moderate our minds in love, and keep our ſelves within the preciſe circuit of Piety and Religion. Reaſon it ſelf pleadeth for a civil behaviour towards all, which in reaſon cannot be denied; And therefore we will begin with Civil Peace.</p>

                     <p>When Chriſt came into the world, he became the corner-ſtone that joyns Jew and Gentile together, who before were divided; <hi>for now both by him making up one myſtical body,</hi> according to that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He is our peace, who

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25.</note> ſhould make no diviſion in the body, but ſhould all have the ſame care one of another. This was Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foretold by a pithie Embleme, by beating of ſwords into ploughſhares,
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">Iſa. 11.6.</note> as the Wolfe and the Lamb, the Leopard and the Kid, the Calfe and the young Lion, the Cow and the Beare: It is a ſweet harmony that the ſympathy of affections, and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in us, whom the Spirit unites together.

                     <p>Be we then exhorted (as ſenſible of being in the preſence of God) to the love one of another; which as learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> defines it, <hi>Appetitus unionis,</hi>

It is like Vipers wine, which being drunk, will never leave working until it diſcover it ſelf, and thoſe inteſtine humours that depend upon it, by ſtirring up ſtrifes, <hi>for hatred stirreth up ſtrifes,</hi> Prov. 10.12,

                     <p>The parts of our diſcourſe are, 1. The glory we owe to God. 2. The peace God ſent on earth. 3. Gods good will towards men.

Although thoſe miſts and fogs of adverſity be never ſo thick, yet ſhall they by him, as by a hot and ſtrong ſun, be diſperſt, and never able to drown us.

                     <p>I can paſs by Gods ſending of his Son, as preſuppoſed being the occaſion of this bleſſed ditty; but I can never paſs by our reſtitution unto grace by him, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt act of good will that ever was: for when ſin had overblackt us with ſuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as left no part cleare, when we ſtood in direct point of diameter to his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and could not avoid the ſentence of condemnation; <hi>through his tender mercy the day-spring from on high did viſit us, and the light of his countenance did ſhine upon us; to give light unto us that ſate in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet into the wayes of peace.</hi> Whereby we now ſtand on firmer and fairer terms of happineſs and proſperity, than before our firſt declination. There is a more eſtabliſhed ſafety in the condition, we have by Chriſt, in Chriſt; than in that firſt wherein we were leſt unto our ſelves. For we fell from that firſt, from this laſt we cannot; and being fallen from that, a better a ſurer cannot be compaſſed but by him.

                     <p>Since then, O God, thy Mercy and thy Goodneſs is of that depth, that no Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is able to found it, and it able to ſatiate all with thy good Spirit, that as by thy Son we are juſtified in thy ſight, ſo by thy Spirit we may be ſanctified; for <hi>Holineſs becometh that houſe wherein thou dwelleſt (O Lord.)</hi>

The firſt are paſſed in ſilence; our ſpeech muſt be of the latter, whom God by ſpecial grace vouchſafes to grace with ſuch endowments, as fit them for glory.</p>
                     <p>There are none begotten by a natural generation, exempted from the contagion of ſin; neither can any in truth glory of a pious conformity of their wills. Papiſts preſume upon a natural ability to gain acceptation at the hands of God; and <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> have given that goodneſs to remain in our wills which doth not; both which, whilſt the wheel is turning, and the ſum of all their misfortunes is caſt up; ſleep ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely in careleſneſs, and boaſt vainly in ſecurity. Divine truth hath diſcovered our nakedneſs and ſhame, ſo that the naked truth without all contradiction is, that what characters of goodneſs were imprinted in our nature by the hand of our Creator, were by the hand of man that catcht hold of the forbidden fruit, quite obliterated and blotted out; inſomuch that unleſs the ſame power take us in hand again, and put upon us the ſtamp of a new creation; we ſhall never alter thoſe crooked and wry diſpoſitions which by our offending diſobedience we have contracted. The life of a Chriſtian doth challenge an higher parentage than from earth, when the beauty thereof is marred, and the emoluments departed,</p>
                     <p>And here the Lords good will hath not been deficient, but ſuperabundant, above what we are able to ask or think: for out of the plentiful treaſures of his grace hath he ſupplied our defects. Firſt he ſent his Son, and behold now he ſends his Spirit: His Son to free us from condemnation, from which otherwiſe we cannot be free, his Spirit for our regeneration, which is an act of Divine power, whereby (being born of God) we are reduced to the obedience of his Name,

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52564:204"/>ſacred actions of obedience that have their original dependencie upon the Divine operation of Gods Spirit in the heart, pleaſe God wonderfully; He is glorified by them, and in them his ſoul takes great pleaſure. <hi>Cui prius non beneplacitum erat in hominibus,

As I breathe (Chriſtians) I cannot but admire the good will of God, who dwelling in that light unto which there can be no acceſs, would vouchſafe to ſhine upon us, who are darkneſs in the very abſtract; or would lift up the light of his countenance upon us, whom ſin had made ſo contemptible. In good earneſt, I am tranſported much more, with the thought of his dwelling in our hearts; whereby whatſoever Satan or our own corruption hath erected there, is pulled down, and whereby all curſed temptations and ſuggeſtions are powerfully van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd. When I conſider, how of impure he makes us pure; how of the ſons of wrath, heirs of an incorruptible crown; and how that he takes delight in our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly holy actions, wherein if he do but mark what is done amiſs, they can never endure the trial. Our lame and limping Holineſs goes for the currant with God in Chriſt Jeſus, who in his good will to us, accepts the good will for the deed, the ſincere deſire for the pure act. Wherefore it was a devout Soliloquy of a retired man,

                     <p>The children of <hi>Adam,</hi> after the fall, deſerve no more to be called the children of God; than that famous weather-beaten Bark of <hi>Athens,</hi> to be called <hi>Theſeus</hi> his Ship; which at firſt was built by him, but in proceſs of years was ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, that it had never a plank the ſame remaining which it had at firſt: So when God did create us upright, we were his whilſt we ſo continued; but when our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity did compaſs us about, and changed our good diſpoſition into an execrable ſtudiouſneſs to work wickedneſs; when the importunate inſtigations of the Tempter did ſet our hearts on fire with the impetuous fury of following ſinful reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; then ceaſed we to be Gods children.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing the ſame hand doth repair us, that firſt made us; and the ſame power make us new creatures, that made us creatures; we again receive the title of Gods children: whoſe inheritance of his good will, is Heaven; whoſe attendants here, and companions there, bleſſed Angels; whoſe glory, God the glory of his Iſrael. <hi>Oh then, that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and his mercy towards the ſons of men.</hi>

                     <p>Again, 2. By following us; After that God hath altered the perverſneſs of our wills, and reſtrained the corruptions of our inordinate nature; his Spirit leaves us not there, but proſecutes what he hath begun in us; not only inclining us to what may win his favour, but directing us, and as it were, leading us by the hand to Chriſt,

                     </list>
                     <p>By preparing of us. Diſobedience is ſo engraffed in our very nature, that none but a metaphyſical and tranſcendent power can moderate our head-ſtrong humors. To temper us to Gods hand whereby to obey the holy Ghoſt, there is requiſite and neceſſary a ſuperior agency, that muſt keep us in from breaking out without fear or wit into exorbitant abominations. In our natural generation there are many proevial and antecedent diſpoſitions and alterations: ſo there are many in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to be born of God; there is a reſtriction of our unbridled appetites, from purſuing things unlawful and prohibited; an illumination of our dark minds in things myſtical; a flexibility of our obſtinate hearts to the love and practice of piety, and an inclination of our rebellious wills and affections to embrace all that's good, as the Spirit ſhall direct: all which proceeding from the good will of God following us for ever, are in them, in whom they are diſcernable; and diſcernable to proceed alone from Gods good will above the courſe of nature.</p>
                     <p>By working in us. Of all Agents, as God is the moſt orderly in proceeding; ſo is he the moſt perfect in working. He brings us not into a poſſibility to be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by adoption, to be holy, to be new creatures; and ſo abruptly breaks off: but makes us in time actually to be ſo. He doth dwell in us, and there works a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. What in his good will he doth begin, in his good will he finiſheth. He gives us both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure. Our freedom then from the dominion of ſin, the renewing of our minds, wills, affections and actions, and our aſſiduous and indefatigable endeavours in Gods ſervices, are the peculiar works of the chiefeſt good, without whom we can do nothing; and are ſpecial expreſſions whereby to diſcern Gods following good will towards men.</p>
                     <p>By coworking with us. Philoſophers do aſcribe the motions of inferiour bodies, to the heavens motion.

                        <hi>Inferiora moventur ad motum ſuperiorum,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Alſted</hi>) theſe bodies which are below, are moved according to the motion of thoſe above. Inſomuch that if they ſhould ceaſe to move, ſo would theſe. Even ſuch (if not greater) is our reference to God. God ſets us a moving in the way to heaven, <hi>Acti agimus:</hi> yet ſuch is the debility of our weak and mortal frame inſufficient for matters of ſuch difficulty, that if he withdraw the ſupporting aſſiſtance of his active Spirit from us, we cannot hold out. Do we preach? 'tis as the Spirits gives us utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; do we pray? the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; do we beleeve? he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our faith and helps our unbelief; do we live the life of grace? Chriſt liveth in us by his Spirit; Are we conſtant in our profeſſion and holy exerciſes of Religion? that conſtancy cometh from above, by the effectual working of the divine power. In all theſe his grace is ſufficient for us, and in doing them his Spirit worketh with us.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning Gods good will towards men, expreſſed in ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                     <p> As for his good will in temporal; it is as clear as the ſun, we need no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe the extraordinary favours of God may not ſlip out of our memories; think upon our deliverance from that intended invaſion in eighty eight, how that part of the invaders became as weak as water, and part were over whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the depths of the ſea alive, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt. Think upon that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid work of darkneſs the Gunpowder plot, how vain the conſpiratours were in their imaginations. The Lords ſtretched out arme overcame the one, his all-ſeeing eye diſcovered the other;
<note place="margin">See thy <hi>Regína Dierum.</hi>
                        </note> and by his Providence were both brought to nothing. Think upon the Stupendious works of Divine Providence, in the wonderful ſafegarding and happy reſtoring of our gracious King, to which I have abundantly ſpoken upon occaſion. Without doubt, all theſe, and infinite more, are ſenſible tokens of Gods good will in Chriſt toward us.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, 1. We may with comfort confidently approach to the throne of grace; where we may receive of the Father whatſoever we ask in his Sons name: for, for his ſake he will deny us no good thing; ſeeing that in him he beares good will toward us. Thus much the occaſion of this text may aſſure us of, which is the incarnation and birth of our Saviour. It being the foundation of all our joyes, and all good things we enjoy. By it, God comforts <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head. <hi>Jacob</hi> is comforted by the viſion of a ladder reaching from heaven to earth, and the Angels aſcending and deſcending by it; the myſtery whereof may be this, The ladder is Chriſt, the foot of it on earth noteth his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, man of the ſubſtance of his mother, born in the world, the top reaching to heaven noteth his divinity,
<note place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> 
                        <hi>God of the ſubſtance of his Father, begotten before all worlds, perfect God and perfect man;</hi> by which union of natures he hath joined earth and heaven together, that is, God and man. The going up and down of Angels by the ladder, ſheweth how by Chriſt the ſervice of Angels is purchaſed unto us; all which accordeth with that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.51. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> (faith our Saviour) <hi>hereafter ye ſhall ſee the heaven open, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man, Job</hi> again comforts himſelf in this, <hi>that his Redeemer</hi> (of his own fleſh, as the word ſignifieth) <hi>liveth.</hi> In the Old Teſtament they which ſought to God came to the Ark or Propitiatory, and there were they heard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Gods bleſſing: Now Chriſt God and man is inſtead thereof, his Godhead being the fountain of all good things, and his fleſh or Manhood a pipe or conduit, to conveigh the fame unto us. Wherefore let us rejoyce in God our Saviour, and comfort our ſelves in his good will towards men.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, 2. We may the better bear temptations and afflictions, and ſlight the aſſaults of the world. That which in <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſerveth the greateſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, is an unmoved patience in ſuffering adverſity, accompanied with a ſettled reſolution of overcoming them. This if we attain unto in Chriſtianity, will ſhield us from deſpair and diſtruſt: for we may be well aſſured, that God to his diſtreſſed ſervants, is the neereſt, when he ſeemeth furtheſt; then ſweeteſt, when he ſeemeth ſowreſt; and then up in wrath to revenge our wrongs, when the world doth think he hath forgot us. For ſtill he beares goad will towards us.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we muſt acknowledge Gods good will through Chriſt, to be the ſole cauſe of all our happineſs. It is a true Maxime in Divinity Publiſht in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, <hi>

                     <p>Thus the Father, the Son and the holy Ghoſt, do all join together in one immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reſolution to prove their good will towards men. The iſſue whereof cannot be but exceeding good. For as Aſtronomers do well obſerve, that when three of the ſuperiour lights do meet in conjunction, it bringeth forth ſome admirable effects. So now, ſeeing that theſe three infinite lights of the world, three perſons of the Deity are met together in one good-will towards men; this benevolous aſpect produceth this admirable effect, that all true beleevers ſhall be hereby exalted into glory. For which, with thankful hearts we ought ever to pay the tribute of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And in aſſurance whereof, to reſt in Gods promiſes, which can never faile. In his name I end, as I did begin; To whom, as the Angels did before us, and duty ever binds us; be rendred all honour and glory both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And where men come ſhort of an invention how to ſcape his ſury and obtain his favour, how to ſatisfy his juſtice and redeem our lives from hell and death: Behold, before the foundation of the world was laid, he reſolved to ſend his own only Son, begotten by an eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who ſhould quell the power of our afflicting enemies, ſtop the mouth of the roaring lyon, overcome the world, ſin, death, the grave and hell; and lay open a plain paſſage into the Kingdom of heaven.

                     <p>This Scripture points at Chriſt, conſidered in part of his twofold ſtate; 1.

                     <p>In it ſelf 'tis a work of power. God was made man, but not ſinful man; which none could bring to paſſe, but God that firſt made man without ſin. The Creator of all made himſelf a creature, which none could do, but the Creator of all. Whereupon it was, that at the conception of the Son of God in the Virgins womb,
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note> the holy Ghoſt came upon her, and <hi>the power of the moſt high did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow her.</hi> Hence, ſaith one, after God had made man, he left nothing but to make himſelf man. A dignity to which the Angels are not call'd, wherewith our nature above all is bleſt.

For that God and man might be one in Covenant,
<note place="margin">Lib. 2. <hi>Inſtitut.</hi>
                        </note> Ood uſed his power to make himſelf and man both one in perſon; <hi>Non communicatione gratiae, fed naturae veritate; non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſione ſubſtantiae, ſed unitate perſonae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Trelcatius,</hi> not by communication of grace,
<note place="margin">Epiphanius.</note> but by reality of nature; not by an undiſtinct confuſion of ſubſtance, but by a perſonal unity. So that, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks, Chriſt was <hi>homo in verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te natus,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.14.</note> Deus in veritate existens;</hi> true God and true man in one and the ſame perſon: which is implied by the Prophet, calling him <hi>Immanuel that is, God with us,</hi> or God in our nature:
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note> Expreſt by the Angel, calling him the Son of God, that ſhould be born of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And manifeſted by the Apoſtle, averring him to come of the Fathers as concerning the fleſh,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> and yet to be over all God bleſſed for ever. This might ſeem exceeding ſtrange; yet it proves not more ſtrange then true. God and man, who ſtood at an infinite diſtance, are now ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly linkt together in one perſon, according to the mighty working of his power. Thus Chriſt's humiliation in being incarnate, is a work of power in it ſelf.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52564:206"/>
                     <p> It is likewiſe a work of power towards us. Since <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion we were all captives unto ſin and Satan, untill God incarnate did vindicate our liberty: We were extremely weakened, our ſpirits fail'd us; until the Lords anointed; <hi>the mighty God of Jacob,</hi> did infuſe into our hearts the ſtrength of his Spirit. His Incarnation made way for our ſalvation; and his taking unto him our humanity, makes us by faith to partake of his Divinity. <hi>Anſelme</hi> moves three queſtions,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſelm. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. c.</hi> 8.</note> to which he gives one ſolid reſolution; the queſtions are theſe, 1. What offence could man commit, which the Son of God made man, could not exprate? 2. Who could be ſo much ſwell'd up with that uncharitable vice of pride, which ſo great humility could not pull down? 3 What dominion could death have over us, which the death of the Son of God could not deſtroy for us? The anſwer's this; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the iniquity of ſinful man, and the grace of my unſpotted Lord, were wigh'd in an even ballance; the Eaſt is not ſo much diſtant from the Weſt, nor the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hell from the higheſt heaven, as my Redeemers goodneſſe (in his humility) doth exceed the wickedneſſe of a ſinner. To this I adde, he hath ſhewn greater power in this act for our redemption, than the malice of all the Devils in hell could put in practice for our confuſion. Thus Chriſt's humiliation is a work of power towards us. And ſo much the rather, he being after this ſort humbled; <hi>was once offered to bear the ſins of many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, it is a work of mercy. <hi>Deus propter hominem ſactus eſt homo: ut eſſet redemptor qui est &amp; Creator, ut de ſuo ridimeretur homo;</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug. Manual; c.</hi> 26.</note> God for mans ſake was made man, that he might be our Redeemer; who is our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo we have of our own wherewith to be redeemed. All of us lay miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſt under the grievous weight of ſin, ſurrounded with extreme miſeries; the foiles that Satan gave us, and the wound that ſin made in us; put us into ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and ſtreights; that did not that good Samaritan the Lord Jeſus raiſe us up, did he not pour oile into our wounds and bind up our killing ſores, we had periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed everlaſtingly without hope of recovery. Which that he might perfectly effect, he took part of our fleſh and blood, whereby being capable of death, he might through death deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.15.</note> and deliver them that through fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. To this, accord <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words, <hi>Chiſtus ſeipſum exinanivit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſervi aſſumpta, non ut quod liberum erat in ſervitutem redigeret,
<note place="margin">Epiphanius.</note> ſed ut in forma quam aſſumpſit, obedientes ſervos liberaret;</hi> Chriſt being in the form of God, equal with God, <hi>made himſelf of no reputation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> but <hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of man, wherein he humbled himſelf, and became obedient to death, even the death of the croſſe;</hi> not that he might bring into ſervitude, what before was free; but that in that aſſumed form, he might free from baſe ſervitude, obedient ſervants.</p>
                     <p>You may remember what <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſaid to Chriſt; <hi>Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldest come under my roof;</hi> yet he did. So might we ſay; Lord, we are not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt dwell among us, and become fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone; yet Chriſt neglecting the Apology, came unto us, in our nature united to himſelf; which the Poſtiller calls <hi>Divinitatis domum,</hi> the houſe of his Divinity.
<note place="margin">Aug. Medit.</note> Upon which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> grounds this comfortable meditation (if the book be his) <hi>Desperare potuiſſem propter nimia peccata mea, niſi verbum tuum Deus caro fieret, &amp; habitaret in nobis;</hi> I could deſpair (O my God) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the multitude of my ſins, were it not that thy Word were made fleſh, and dwelt in us. Wherefore his coming into the world, and that in mercy, to ſave ſinners that could not ſave themſelves; may keep our hearts from diſtruſt, from deſpair; and cauſe us to ſet up our reſt and confidence in him alone; who hath ſuffered for ſin, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chriſt's humiliation is a work of juſtice. For it is juſt with God to put in execution, <hi>what before all times he did determine ſhould come to paſſe.</hi> All mankind ſtood guilty and forlorn before the barre of Gods exact juſtice, until our Advocate, who is the propitiation for our ſins, did fetch us off; which could not be ſo fairly, ſo conveniently done; unleſſe he were made like unto us his brethren.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52564:207"/>The ſupreme wiſdom therefore to preſerve his juſtice unſpotted, and withal to manifeſt the riches of his grace, upon the veſſels of his mercy; made his Son in the fulneſs of time, the Son of man; that ſo his juſtice (as was right and meet) might receive a plenary ſatisfaction, from that nature that had offended. Hence it was the Lords reſolution, in bringing many Sons to glory, according to his determinate counſel; to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings. This was in equity requiſite,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.10.</note> 
                        <hi>Quod per eum homo redimendus erat, in quo redemptio noſtra ab aeterno paedeſtinata fuerat;</hi> For that by him we were to be redeemed, in whom from all eternity our redemption was decreed.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Trelcatius In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. cap.</hi> 2.</note> By him we were to be made up again, by whom we were firſt made. We ought to be partakers of the love of God in him, who was the onely Son of Gods eternal love. In a word, we were to receive the right of adoption and liberty of ſons through him, who by nature was the everlaſting Son and heir of the Father. Hence, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note> made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> Wherein, that we might have a ſure intereſt and juſt claime without any ſtrife; Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Chriſt fitted in power, in mercy, in juſtice, to be <hi>made a ſacrifice for ſin;</hi> whom we will now conſider more particularly according to the parts of the text; and firſt of the perſon humbled, which is Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was deſign'd from all eternity to be the ſole Mediatour between God and man; and to this end was both God and man, to reconcile both God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe both ſtood at an infinite diſtance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and could not come together but by an infinite perſon, which is God alone. Our ſins like a cloud interpoſed betwixt God and us, made us ſtrangers to heaven; ſo that the light of Gods countenance could not be liſted up upon us, nor the comfortable heames of his ſaving grace reflect upon our ſoules. Could any of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> diſpel the cloud of our ſins, or make way for Gods grace to deſcend to us, or for us to aſcend to God? there could not. We have all erred with our firſt father, and cannot indure the preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Fear and trembling ſeize upon ſoul and body, upon the apprehenſion of his preſence. But could any of the Angels work our peace with heaven? there could not. For they being creatures mutable in their wills as well as men; ſtood in need of an Head, by whoſe neer union unto them, they ſhould inſeperably be joined unto God. For ever then moſt lamentable had been the condition of man, did not Gods infinite Majeſty vouchſafe to deſcend to us; <hi>aſcendere noſtrum non erat,</hi> it was not in our power to aſcend to him. Hence is he called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, which name imports thus much, that as he hath joined his Divinity with our nature; ſo hath he coupled our nature to his Divinity; that ſo he might be a perfect and ſufficient Mediatour, according to that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. One God, and one Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus. For did he not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of both natures, had he not been man as well as God, he had been a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to us, and therefore unfit for the office of Mediatour. To bring us therefore unto God, he united our man-hood to his divine nature; by which union we are made partakers of the divine nature, whereby our peace is for ever concluded upon.</p>
                     <p>The great acts and worthy deſigns,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that by him as Mediator were undertaken to be performed, ſhew how he was God and Man. He did ſo reſtore us into the favour of our God, that of the ſons of men we became the ſons of God; and that of the heirs of Hell, he made us heirs of Heaven. But who could bring this to paſs, unleſs the Son of God were made the Son of Man; and unleſs what was his by nature, he had made ours by grace. And here we may be as bold, as to conclude we are the ſons of God; becauſe the natural Son of God aſſumed body of our body, fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones; that he might be the ſame with us, and we the ſame with him. Thus he became our Kinſman, to whom of property by the old Law it did belong to redeem his brethren. Which that he might effect, he did conquer Death; and who could do this, but he who is our Life? He did vanquiſh Sin; and who could do this, but Righteouſneſs it ſelf? He did bring into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52564:207"/>his ſubjection the Forces of the world, and the Powers that rule in the air; and who could do this, but he that is the Power of God? And who is this Life, this Righteouſneſs, this Power of God, but Jeſus Chriſt very God of very God, and yet the Son of Man?</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was God and Man: Man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that ſin might be puniſhed in the nature offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet Man without ſin, to fulfill that Righteouſneſs, which none of us ſold under ſin can fulfill. He was Man, that as by the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin entred into the world; ſo by the obedience of him who is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> righteouſneſs ſhould bring juſtification to life: And <hi>as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, many ſhall be made righteous.</hi> By the righteouſneſs of his obedience Active and Paſſive: Active, in perfecting all the duties injoined by the Law; Paſſive, in ſuffering the wrath of God, the puniſhment of our diſobedience: Thus our confuſion is taken away, and life and righteouſneſs are reſtored unto us. And he was God withal, that the Juſtice of God might receive compleat ſatisfaction, by a puniſhment that ſhould be infinite, or equal to infinite; which none but God could give: And therefore Chriſt is ſaid, as God, to have <hi>purchaſed his Church with his own blood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 20. 1 Joh. 3.16.</note> and <hi>to lay down his life for us.</hi> And though his puniſhment was not ſo infinite, but that it was finite; yet it was only finite for time, but was for value, as it ought to be, infinite. Thus the Son of True God did bear the burden of his Fathers wrath in our nature; which no other Nature ought to do, but the ſoul that ſinned; which no other but God could do, becauſe God is a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and his wrath unquenchable by any creature.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as God alone could not die, becauſe not ſubject to paſſion; nor Man alone overcome death, becauſe too weak:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It was requiſite that our Redeemer who ſhould die for our ſins, ſhould be both; that by the weakneſs of the one nature he might ſubmit himſelf to the power of death, thereby to undergo puniſhment due to ſin; and by the ſtrength of the other he ſhould by ſuſtaining the Manhood make good his part againſt death, and ſwallow it up in victory. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? But thanks be to God,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sarcaſmo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flat &amp; hoſtili deriſione, quâ mors ridenda propinatur,</hi> ſaith one.</note> that hath given us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus much of the Perſon humbled, which is Chriſt, God and Man. The next point to be diſcuſs'd, is, Wherein his Humiliation did conſiſt; that is, in general, <hi>He ſuffered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the time of his nativity, to the very hour of his death, was he not free from ſuffering. He was no ſooner born, but <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his life. He was ſubject to the infirmities of our nature, ſin excepted; He was hungry and thirſty, weary and faint, ſorrowful and diſcontented; his poverty was extream, though Lord of all, and Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, he had not ſo much as whereon to lay his head: Grievous was the temptation he ſuffered by Satans onſet; infinite were the injuries that were offered him by the curſed brats of Satan, both in word and deed; In word by falſe calumnies and forged accuſations, by contumelious detractions and curſed blaſphemies; In deed, by framing of projects and laying of plots, how to take away his life. <hi>He was deſpiſed, and rejected of men; a man of ſorrowes, and acquainted with grief, and we hid, as it were, our faces from him.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> He was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not; ſurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our ſorrowes: Yet we eſteemed him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> His whole life was a perpetual paſſion; He was never let alone, until upon the Croſs <hi>he gave himſelf a ranſom for all;</hi> and his enemies never ceaſed, until they drew out his hearts blood, which he for our redemption in his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was willing to part withall. He had power in his own hand to lay down his life, and he had power to aſſume it again: For albeit his life lay at the ſtake, yet could he (were he ſo diſpoſed) command legions of Angels (beſide his own power which was alſufficient) to deliver him, either by putting his enemies to flight, or by repreſſing their violence, that either they would not, or they ſhould not hurt him; or by utterly ſubverting them. But being that he came into the world to the end to ſuffer, to compaſs for us a world without all end; he withdrew not his neck from the yoke, but ſet himſelf forward to bear the iniquity of us all laid upon him.</p>
                     <p>Thus Chriſt was ſubject to paſſion, but not according to his divine, but humane
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52564:208"/>nature: For as he is God, he is <hi>Actus puriſſimus,</hi> and cannot ſuffer; but yet he being God, ſuffered in the nature aſſumed, which was capable of ſuffering, that is, in his Manhood. So that here we have the higheſt Perſon, and the loweſt Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation met together. Wherefore in this ſuffering of our Lord, there are three things according to <hi>Bernards</hi> obſervation ſpecially noted;
<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                        <hi>Opus, modus, cauſa: In opere patientia, in modo humilitat, in cauſa charitas commendatur; Patientia ſingularis, humilitas admirabilis, ſed charitas ineſtimabilis:</hi> There are the work, the manner of performing, and the cauſe: In the work, which is ſuffering, his patience is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; in the manner, his humility; in the cauſe, his charity; for charity moved him to ſuffer with patience and humility: His patience is ſingular, none like it; his humility admirable, none ever came, never ſhall come near it; his charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable, for it is incomparable. All which may appear unto you, by preſenting to your view his ſpecial ſufferings immediately preceding his death.</p>
                     <p>In theſe ſufferings of our Saviour, you may ſee the fouleſt act of Treaſon that ever was committed, the greateſt Cruelty that was ever heard of; both hatcht in the pit of hell. <hi>Judas,</hi> his familiar friend, comes and betrays him with a falſe-hearted complement, a Kiſs; his love was only from the teeth outward, deceit was in his heart, and the poiſon of aſps under his lips; but no wonder, the Devil was in him. <hi>Peter</hi> his Diſciple, than whom none more forward in times paſt to <hi>confeſs him to be the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> is moſt forward to <hi>deny him;</hi> his former proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were forgotten, his preſent commodity only thought upon. And when the raſcal multitude came forth with ſwords and ſtaves, and brought him to the Council, all his friends forſook him; the Shepherd ſmitten, the ſheep were ſcattered. Friends and foes, Jews and Gentiles, men and women, high and low, rich and poor, Prince and people, added ſomething to his Paſſion, to augment his woe. <hi>The Kings of the earth took counſel together against the Lord, and againſt his Anointed.</hi> The Elders of the people, the chief Prieſts and the Scribes, beat their brains together to take away his life: They ſend him to <hi>Pilate, Pilate</hi> ſends him to <hi>Herod, Herod</hi> ſends him to <hi>Pilate</hi> again, and <hi>Pilate</hi> ſends him to his death. Thus was he toſſed from poſt to pillar. In all theſe places he ſuffered in his good name, by blaſphemous ſpeeches uttered againſt him, in numbring him amongſt tranſgreſſors, placing him betwixt two thieves: In his honor and glory, by opprobrious terms and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous irriſions and mockings: In his ſubſtance, in that they took away his garment: In his ſoul he ſuffered ſorrow and anguiſh, and great fear ſurpriſed his heart: In his body he ſuffered wounds and ſtripes. Inſomuch that it may be ſaid, <hi>Was ever any ſorrow like his ſorrow?</hi> Were you preſent to behold the whole paſſage of his Paſſion, you might ſee his head compaſſed about with a crown of ſharp thorns, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of a crown of pure gold; you might ſee his glorious Viſage, which the very Angels admired, contemptuouſly ſpitted upon; and his cheeks ſmitten with the palms of their hands: You might ſee his hands and feet faſt nailed to the Croſs, which he himſelf did carry; and his ſides thruſt thorow with a ſpear: You might ſee his blood trickling down to the ground; and himſelf, through the pangs of death, and apprehenſion of the Fathers wrath lighting upon him for our ſins, crying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Hereupon ſaith <hi>Bernard, O bone Jeſu, quid tibi eſt? nos peccavimus, &amp; tu luis; opus ſine exemplo, gratia ſine merito, charitas ſine imo:</hi> O bleſſed Saviour, what ails thee? We ſinned, and thou by thy blood doſt expiate our ſins; here is a work without example, grace without merit, and love beyond all meaſure. He felt the wrath of God upon his ſoul: he felt the hand of a ſin revenging Judge, taking vengeance for the ſins of the world, upon him, then taking away the ſin of the world.

                     <p>Having waded thus farre, I ſeale up this diſcourſe with a pathetical concluſion, in way of application.</p>
                     <p>O how far is the love of God extended to us miſerable ſinners! He was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent before our fall, to find out away, whereby to be ſaved after we fell. His Son muſt die, to ſave us from death. He muſt fall into the hands of ſinners, that we may not fall into the hands of Satan. <hi>And if he have thus given us his Son, how ſhall he not with him give unto us all things?</hi> We may conclude for certain, we ſhall want nothing for the furtherance of our ſalvation, <hi>ſince that he with-held not his onely Son from us.</hi> Let this love of God to us, extract love from us to God. As he bought us dear with the loſſe of his Son, ſo muſt we think nothing too deare to part withal to gain our God. We muſt be content to loſe our life and all; than to loſe our God <hi>who is all in all,</hi> for the gaining of life and all.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that Chriſt ought to have ſuffered for our ſins, we may well grieve that we ſhould be the authors of his death; and yet rejoyce that we have eſcaped Gods fearful vengeance by his ſufferings. Grieve then, my beloved, for your ſins, <hi>for which Chriſt died;
<note place="margin">Royard in Poſtill</note> and go and ſin no more.</hi> And <hi>let your ſoules magnify the Lord, and rejoyce in God your Saviour. Non gaudere ingratitudinis eſt, non dolere crudeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Royard;</hi> not to be glad for Gods mercy and Chriſt's love in redeeming us, is a point of ingratitude; not to grieve that we gave occaſion of his death, is a point of the greateſt cruelty. Let us then grieve together with him, that we may reigne and rejoyce together with him.</p>
                     <p>Gods decree is unutterable; he ordained that Chriſt ſhould die, and Chriſt did die. He promiſt it, and 'tis fulfill'd. He revealed it, and 'tis ſo come to paſſe. He is as good as his word. Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but not the leaſt tittle of his word ſhall go unfulfilled. What therefore ſoever God hath determined concerning any one, ſhall certainly fall out ſo; there is no avoidance. What he hath denounced againſt ſinners, let them expect it, for they ſhall ſurely have it. Our God is a God of truth.</p>
                     <p>You may collect out of this diſcourſe, that Chriſt is a perfect and ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<note place="margin">Heb 10.14.</note> on whom alone dependeth our ſalvation. <hi>For by one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the children of <hi>Iſrael, the Lord ſhall fight for you, and you ſhall hold your peace;</hi> So I may ſay, that Chriſt onely fought for us; we did nothing whereby to acquire a life that is endleſs. Wherefore if we will be perfectly ſaved, rely upon the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for he is onely <hi>the Captain of our ſalvation.</hi> Look up (as ſometimes the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on the brazen ſerpent) upon him ſtretched out upon the croſſe, where <hi>he is ready to receive all, that come unto him, and beleeve in his name. Caput Chriſti inclinatum ad oſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landum, cor apertum ad diligendum, brachia extenſa ad amplexandum, totum corpus expoſitum ad redimendum;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. de virginit.</note> he hath his head bended down to kiſſe you, his heart opened to love and affect you, his armes ſtretched forth to embrace you, his whole body expoſed to redeem you.</p>

His life ſeem'd to the worlds eye inglorious, in that he affected not popularity; ſo did his death, to thoſe that knew not the myſtery of our Redemption. By general judgment he was reputed the moſt unhappy breathing; he was rejected and deſpiſed of men. Yet in this his rejected and contemptible condition, was ſowen his immortal happineſs; which indeed was ſowen in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but was raiſed in power; ſowen in diſhonor, but raiſed in glory.</p>
                     <p>For as by the eternal conſtitution of the Almighty, he ought to have been brought to the loweſt degree of miſery, by ſuffering divers and fearful puniſhments; ſo ought he not perpetually to abide in that ſtate; but at length to be elevated thence, to the higheſt pitch of glory. In order to which, as Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered; ſo alſo muſt he riſe again from the dead.</p>
                     <p>The point now by divine aſſiſtance to be diſcuſt, is part of Chriſts exaltation; a theame of an high nature. And herein, firſt of the perſon exalted; Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was exalted according to both natures,

                     </p>
                     <p>The exaltation of the Godhead of Chriſt, was the manifeſtation of the Godhead in the Manhood; mightily declaring therein that he was the Son of God. Which manifeſtation, was altogether active, no way paſſive; the effects produced by him having no other proper agent but God. For who could overcome Satan, death, the world, the grave; but God? And albeit the Divine nature be thus exalted, yet it is without all manner of alteration. For to ſpeak properly, in it ſelf it cannot be made the ſubject of exaltation; but as it is conſidered joined with the Manhood, into the unity of one perſon. For albeit Chriſt from the very time of the aſſumption of our nature, whereby he was incarnate, was both God and man, and his Godhead all the time he liv'd dwelt in his Manhood; yet from the hour of his Nativity, unto the hour of giving up the Ghoſt, and a while after; the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52564:211"/>Godhead did little ſhew it ſelf. The glorious majeſty of his Deity whiles he was in the for me and low ſtate of a ſervant, lay hid under the vaile of his fleſh, as the ſoul doth in the body, when a man is ſleeping. And in the time of his paſſion, the brightneſs of the glory of the ſun of righteouſneſſe was obſcured; as the ſun running in the height of heaven, oftimes over clouded or eclipſed by a darker body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But as ſoone as this work was finiſhed, and happily accompliſhed; he began by degrees to make known the power of his Godhead in his Manhood; And ſo to riſe again.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt was exalted in regard of his Manhood; which conſiſteth in theſe two things.</p>

                        <hi>Eſt ejuſdem naturae, ſed alterius gloriae;</hi> ſaid <hi>Thomas;</hi> for God would not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption. The nature and eſſential proprietles of a true body, as length, breadth, thickneſs, locality, ſtill remain in him; (the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of glory and brightneſs not changing the nature of it) ſo that it is free from all bodily imperfections, and made bright and glorious; a reſemblance whereof, was his tranſiguration on the mount,
<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> where his face did ſhine as the ſun, and his rayment was as white as the light; the purity whereof is unblemiſhed, the agility whereof, ſuch as is indifferent to move upward or downward; the brightneſs thereof cannot be obſcured, nor the ſtrength thereof match't by any creature. For by his power he ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body;
<note place="margin">Hhil. 3.21.</note> according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe gifts of glory in Chriſt's body are not infinite, but bounded within limits; becauſe his humane nature being but a creature, and therefore finite, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive infinite graces and gifts of glory. To make then infiniteneſs, ubiquity and omnipotency, incommunicable attributes of God, attributes of Chriſt's glorified body; is to deſtroy the nature of a body, and ſay that the body of Chriſt is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Deity, or Deified; and that he is all God, no man, all ſpirit no body; And beſides, it argues an impoſſibility, for no creature can be changed into the Creatonr, no finite body into an infinite and eternal ſubſtance. It ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52564:211"/>us to know, that Chriſt's ſoul and body were conditioned according to the deſcription given, when he entred into his glory.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of the perſon exalted, Chriſt; <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, despiſing the ſhame,

                     </p>
                     <p>We are next to conſider Chriſt's exaltation, the degrees of which are threefold; the firſt degree is his Reſurrection; anſwering to the firſt degree of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which was his death. The ſecond degree is his aſcenſion, anſwering the ſecond of his humiliation, which was his burying. The third degree (which is the height of his exaltation) is his <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God;</hi> oppoſed to the loweſt of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, which was, his deſc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>My text limits me to the firſt degree of his exaltation; which is his Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                     <p>It was a cruel conflict that Chriſt had upon the croſſe; he had his own Father againſt him, taking vengeance upon him, for the ſins of the world; he had Satan againſt him, who out of a malicious diſpoſition plotted and attempted his ruine; he had the world againſt him, in bruing their hands and their hearts in his blood; <hi>his blood be upon us and our children,</hi> ſay the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The chief Prieſts, the Scribes, the common people, the ſouldiers <hi>bandied themſelves together against the Lord, and againſt his annointed.</hi> So cloſe was their purſuing of him, that indeed he received the foile; they pierced his hands and his feet with nailes, and his ſides with a ſpeare; in the end, they ended his dayes, the height of their malice. But not long after, he reviv'd, <hi>for the third day he roſe again;</hi> which he did for his own greater glory, for his and our enemies more ſhamefull overthrow, and for his diſciples firmer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. This was foretold by himſelf, this was teſtified by men and Angels, and is beleeved, that he roſe the third day.</p>
                     <p>Our faith in this is underpropt, not only by the teſtimony of Angels and men;
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.46.</note> but alſo by Scripture and Arguments. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day.</hi> By Arguments containing manifeſt demonſtrations of the truth of his reſurrection, drawn from,

                     </p>
                     <p>In that which is drawn from his dody, Chriſt doth declare three things; 1. That his body was a true, real, ſubſtantial and ſollid dody: And not framed onely in the imagination, or compoſ'd all of an airy ſubſtance. <hi>Feele and ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have.</hi> 2. That his body was a humane body, by ſhewing how that he had the true and perfect effigies and expreſſions or a man, to be ſeen by the eye. 3. That it was the very ſame numerical body, which he h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d before; by laying open to the view, the grievous wounds which he ſuffered in his body. <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is my ſelf.</hi> The wounds in his body, diſcover the naked truth of his reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>In the Argument which is deducted from his ſoul reunited to his body, his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is proved, and that by the operations and works of the threefold life proceeding from the ſoul, whereof man is partaker. 1. By the works of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life; in that he did eat and drink with them. 2. By the works of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life; his anſwers to his diſciples; giving evidences of his hearing; his diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from others, of his ſeeing. 3. By the works of the intellective life; in his diſcourſes and explications of the profound myſtery of the croſſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the time when he roſe was the third day. He lay not dead in the grave three compleat dayes, under the dominion of death; for then he ſhould not have riſen till the fourth day. So that he was but one day and two pieces of two dayes in the grave; for he was buried in the evening before the Sabbath, and roſe in the morning the next day after the Sabbath. The Friday evening he was buried, the ſunday morning he roſe again; which was the firſt day of the week, and is now our Sabbath, obſerved in memory of his glorious riſing, who is the Sun of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52564:212"/>Righteouſneſs, from death unto life. And as in the firſt Day of the firſt World, <hi>Light was commanded to ſhine out of darkneſs, upon the deeps:</hi> So in the firſt Day of this new World (made new by Chriſt) this glorious Sun (after its Eclipſe come to its period) appeared in the brightneſs of his glory, and gives light for ever <hi>to thoſe that ſit in darkneſs;</hi> and diſpels thoſe clouds of obſcurity that were under the Old Teſtament, from the Chriſtian world. So long he reſted in the grave, as three days, yet not full; for a demonſtraiton of the truth of his death: And no longer, that his body might not ſee corruption. For had he riſen preſently, we might doubt of the truth of his death: Had he remained longer in the grave, or unto the end of the world; his body would according to the courſe of nature be corrupted; and we might doubt of the truth of his Divinity, which required for the manifeſtation of his power, a quick reſurrection of his body, and a reuniting of the ſoul thereunto. To confirm therefore our faith in both, <hi>He roſe the third day from the dead, to enter into his glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the power by which he was raiſed, it was not by any other than his own. Though this act be attributed to the Father, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. yet, it is his power too. For, whatſoever is the Father's, is his, becauſe <hi>He and the Father are one.</hi> It was the power of his Divinity,

                     <p n="2">2. It was neceſſary, for the inſtruction and ſettlement of our Faith, (we being naturally prone to infidelity:) And that, 1. Concerning the Divinity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, the glory and truth whereof had not been made ſufficiently apparent, had he not uſed his power in riſing again: But in that he is riſen, he hath mightily declared himſelf to be the <hi>Son of God,

                     <p>Again, it was neceſſary for the ſettlement of our Faith, 2. Concerning the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Chriſt hath gotten over death. The weaker is overcome of the ſtronger; ſo that if Chriſt had not riſen, he had been weaker than Death; had not been a ſufficient Redeemer, we had been ſtill in our ſins; we could not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, God had received perfect ſatisfaction: But being that he is revived by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52564:212"/>the ſame Power, that giveth life unto all; Death hath no longer dominion over him; Gods juſtice is ſatisfied, and we remain no longer in our ſins. Wherefore we may well in the language of triumph proclaim, <hi>O death, where is thy ſling?

Our times upon the Earth may be ſaid to be laſting, but not ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; though in the hands of God. Heaven decreed a period to our Lives, which we cannot prevent; and to which Chriſt at the appointed houre did ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all obedience, not able to avoid it.

                     <p>From which diſcourſe may be deduced three concluſions, 1. That this Spirit of the Son is a Perſon; he <hi>proceeds from the Father and the Son,</hi> not as an accident, but as a Perſon. It was the groſſe conceit of ſome heretical miſtaken ſpirits, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in their judgments, that this Spirit of the Son, is only a motion or quality wrought by God in the hearts of his children, or ſome divine inſpiration infuſed from above by divine grace into the ſoules of them whom God had choſen out of the world, to be more eminent than others. Thoſe conceits may ſeem plauſible to corrupted reaſon, <hi>not diſcerning the things of God, which are spiritually diſcerned:</hi> yet they contradict that which by Infallible conſequence may be deducted out of the ſacred truths of Gods word and right reaſon. Laying therefore theſe two, Gods word and right reaſon as two ſure foundations and uncontrolable Principles, which may juſtly ſway our judgments: I will preſſe the truth of this concluſion againſt all oppoſites.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of the Son is a perſon. Becauſe he appeared in a viſible ſhape. The Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily ſhape like a Dove upon Chriſt: and he appeared like cloven tongues of fire, and ſate upon each of the diſciples, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

                     <p>He is a Perſon, becauſe we are baptized in his Name.

                     <p>Again, becauſe he is ſaid to be another from them both. <hi>I will ask the Futher,

                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, He hath a relative property and characteriſtical note ſeveral from theirs, putting a difference betwixt them and him: He onely proceeds from the Father and the Son; He onely appeared under the form of an innocent Dove, and of fiery cloven tongues; By his immediate operation, Chriſt was conceived in the womb of the Virgin: and by his immediate operation, Gods children are throughly ſanctified and furniſhed unto every good work.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, The Father ſends him, that ſo ſends him, whence he is neither the Father nor the Son, but one from them. It is a marvellous impropriety of ſpeech, that a man ſhould be ſaid to ſend himſelf; but proper it is to ſay, he comes of his own accord. Foraſmuch therefore as the Spirit is ſaid to be ſent from the Father and the Son; and as here, <hi>God ſent forth the Spirit of his Son;</hi> He is a Perſon diſtinct from them both. Which is the thing I intended to demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>As he is a Perſon, ſo is he the third and laſt Perſon: not laſt in time, nor laſt in nature, nor laſt in dignity; but laſt in the order and manner of ſubſiſting, and of performing ſuch works as are common to them all, called works <hi>ab extra,</hi> as Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Redemption, Preſervation, Juſtification, Sanctification, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Having briefly gone over theſe two points, I ſhall endeavour by Gods grace to do the like in the next, which is this, 3. <hi>That there are Three Perſons in the Deity, to whom the Divine Eſſence is communicated; The Father, the Son; the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For humane Reaſon fully to conceive ſo high a myſtery, is impoſſible: What

                        <hi>John;</hi> hence by <hi>Lombard</hi> ſaid to be that Love wherewith the Father loves the Son, the Son the Father. So the Text reckons up three, the Father, the Son, the Spirit; <hi>God ſent forth the Spirit of his Son.</hi> This is indeed a deep myſtery: Yet as abſtruſe as this Divine myſtery of the Trinity is, Nature can give us ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight (by ſimilitudes, though imperfect) of the poſſibility and truth of it.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that in the Sun, there is an indeſinent fountain of light, a brightneſs and ſplendor ſpringing out of it, and a quickning and reviving heat proceeding from it; yet none will be ſo foully miſtaken, as to conclude out of theſe three, that there are three Suns, there being ſtill but one: So though the Eſſence of the Godhead be but one, yet we muſt know, it is communicated unto three Perſons; and though communicated unto three Perſons, yet ſtill the Eſſence is but one. We ſee that in Man there are two diverſe and far different natures, a Body and a Soul; yet theſe two make not two Men, but one, theſe reteining the unity of one Perſon: If two diverſe Natures met together make one Perſon, why may not one Nature and Eſſence be communicated to Three, and thoſe Three having one and the ſame Eſſence, ſtill remain one God? We ſee that in the Soul of Man there is a Will, which is the immediate beginning <hi>ab intra</hi> of every act proceeding from our ſelves, commanding this or that to be done, <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo;</hi> then there is Reaſon that thinks of the means to compaſs the intent of the Will; which being found, there is a Power which is ſtill in action, till the Will (as I may ſo ſay) gets its will and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its end: whence is drawn a ſimilitude to expreſs the profound myſtery of the Trinity: The <hi>Father</hi> is compared to the Will, for he is the beginning of the action; the <hi>Son</hi> to Reaſon, for to him is given the diſpenſation of all things, and he is the Wiſdom of the Father; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to the Faculty or Power of effecting it, who is the Perfecter of every act, called <hi>The Power of the moſt High.</hi> Theſe three ſaculties are in the ſoul of man, yet one ſoul, not three; and 'tis a queſtion never ſatisfactorily decided ſince firſt moved, Whether theſe eſſentially and really differ from the ſoul, or no: If then theſe three faculties of the ſoul be one ſoul, and one ſoul theſe three faculties; why may not the Eſſence of the Godhead be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to three Perſons, and theſe three Perſons remain one onely God?</p>
                     <p>Thus the glimmering light of Nature hath given us ſome light in this matter;

                     <p>What greater gift can God give to the ſons of men? what greater gift can the ſons of men expect of God? Enough, enough Lord; thou art God Alſufficient, we can ask no more; and thou canſt ſend no greater than the Spirit of thy Son into our hearts.</p>
                     <p>I will not part from this point, till I clear one doubt. In that God ſends the <hi>Spirit of his Son;</hi> ſome infer, that God and the Holy Spirit are unequal; the Sender muſt ever be greater than the Meſſenger, the Giver than the Gift.</p>

                        </gap>able, That there is no inequality in the Deity. 2. Common experience in Civil affairs, is able to demonſtrate this, That equals may ſend forth equals; it is uſual. 3. S.
<note place="margin">Cyril.</note> 
                        <hi>Cyrils</hi> rule is moſt forcibly true, That <hi>Miſſio &amp; obedientia non tollunt aqualitatem;</hi> Miſſion and ſubmiſſion nullifie not equality. <hi>The Father ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, in the form of a ſervant, and was obedient unto death, even the curſed death of the Croſs;</hi> Yet equal to the Father, <hi>He thought it no robbery.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> So the Holy Ghoſt in equality is not a jot diminiſhed, nor his authority any thing abated, though ſent of the Father. The Father is not greater than the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt leſs than either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all three are one and the ſame God, Infinite in Eſſence and Lord of all; and in Unity there is no Inequality.</p>
                     <p>Here I put a period to my diſcourſe of this point, and proceed to the next, to wit, to the Miſſion or ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of the Son, <hi>God ſent forth the Spirit of his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſending of the Spirit, is either in a viſible or inviſible manner. Viſibly he is ſaid to be ſent, when there are ſignificant ſigns of his preſence: Not that the Spirit in its own nature is viſible to the eyes of man: When he confers his ſaving
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52564:217"/>graces by the uſe of external Symbols, working Faith and Repentance in his Church; when by his powerful operation he converteth the ſouls of ſinners from the errors of their way; in an outward apparition, then is he ſaid to be ſent viſibly: the Dove appearing at Chriſts Baptiſm, did intimate the preſence and the efficacy of the holy Ghoſt; the cloven tongues like fire in the Primitive Church, in the times of the Apoſtles, were a demonſtration of his preſence and power. The manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his graces in Chriſt and his Apoſtles at thoſe times, diſcovered his preſence. But he is not ſent thus alwayes, but at appointed times, and upon ſpecial occaſions; thus that Propheſie of <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. was fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>He is ſent inviſibly, when no ſignes are uſed to declare his preſence in our hearts; only he that hath him knows he is there. Thus was he in the Prophets, for he ſpake by them: And every Chriſtian that belongs to the election of grace, hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſent him thus inviſibly; <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his, Rom.</hi> 8.9. And <hi>cum gratia Spiritus ſancti datur hominibus, profecto mittitur, Spiritus à Patre,</hi> when the grace of the Spirit is confer'd on men, of a truth the Spirit of grace is ſent then of the Father. Chriſt's Spirit comes not to us by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral motion, but by the temporal motion of the creature is ſignified the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and inviſible ſending of Chriſt's Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Again, he is ſent unto us by the Miniſtry of the Word, the power of God to our ſalvation, and by the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. By the Word illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating our underſtandings, before darkned; enabling us to judge of ſpiritual things, our judgment before reſtrained to carnal: working ſaith, love, hope, peace, patience, temperance, with a reformation of our lives and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in our hearts. By adminiſtration of the Sacraments, confirming our faith in the promiſes, ſealing unto us our adoption, perfecting in us the aſſurance of our reconciliation with God, and aſſuring us that we ſhall be made partakers with the Saints in glory, of the full fruition of the preſence of God, and be put into the poſſeſſion of that immortal and eternal inheritance in the higheſt heavens prepared for Gods children, <hi>before the foundations of the world were laid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſending of the Spirit of the Son, either viſibly or inviſibly, by the Word or Sacraments, is not a local motion, a going from one place to another, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from heaven to earth; but his operation and effectual working in the hearts of Gods Saints. He is every where filling heaven and earth, and therefore not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from heaven to earth, but <hi>ubi operatur ibi eſt,</hi> where he works, there he is, and is ſaid to be ſent thither.</p>
                     <p>Let us now learn how to conceive of God; and be aſſured of his love, had he not loved us, he had not ſent his Spirit to us. He ſends his Spirit to us, and gives us the beſt things; we muſt not deny any thing unto him, thankleſſe creatures then we ſhould be. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> And prepare we our hearts to entertain and receive him; ſweeping clean the ſecret chambers of our ſouls; making our bodies alſo fit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the holy Ghoſt to dwell in.</p>
                     <p>The firm ground of all Chriſtian comfort, and ſtedfaſt foundation of all the heirs of eternal bliſſe, is to be the ſons of God, Men of this world are ever am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of honorable titles, and uſe all means to inſinuate themſelves into the favor of their Prince, aiming hereby at a worldly happineſſe. Thus men of the world to come (ſo I may term the faithful, for they are not of this world) are ever in action, and the bent of their endeavours ever tending to obtain the honorable title of the ſons of God. What means God hath ordained for them to win his favour by; as obedient children uſe, aiming hereby at an eternal inheritance, and at the crown of immortality that never fades away: which, that as ſons, they by the grace of God their heavenly Father, may compaſſe; they cry and pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing unto him, who is willing to hear, and able to fulfil their holy deſires to the utmoſt, even above what they ask. And that they may be the better able to hold out unto the end, and to profecute their earneſt intentions in righteous things; God, becauſe they are ſons, ſends forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts, <hi>whereby they cry, Abba Father.</hi>

                     <p> There remains now theſe three Parts to be treated of; The place whither the Spirit is ſent; the effect of the Spirit there; and the reaſon of all this. Now, that you may receive with pure hearts, and blameleſſe affection, the ſincere truth of Gods holy word; whil'ſt ye are reading theſe lines, ſequeſter your ſences and your ſouls, from all wandring and evil thoughts, and caſt away from you all miſdeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceits, as <hi>Elias</hi> did his Mantle to the earth, when he aſcended into heaven; or as <hi>Moſes</hi> took off his ſhoes, when he trod on holy ground.</p>
                     <p>The next Subject of our Meditation, is the place whither God ſends forth the Spirit of his Son, which is our hearts. God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts.</p>
                     <p>The eſtate of every true Chriſtian and child of God in this life, is partly carnal, partly ſpiritual; they have fleſh, they have ſpirit; the firſt ſtate comes by nature, call'd the ſtate of nature; the ſecond by the free and undeſerved grace of God,

To the Law of the mind, which is the Law of God, call'd the Law of the mind regenerate and illuminated, converted unto God by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherein the godly do delight. Hence ariſeth a mortal warre, and an unsppeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enmity within man. <hi>I ſee,</hi> faith <hi>Paul, another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind; the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not do, that do I,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the spirit,

As fire doth purge and take out the droſs from the good mettal; ſo doth the holy Ghoſt ſeparate and eat out the putrifying corruptions of ſin out the canker'd and droſſie heart of man. And thus regeneration is wrought by the Spirit, and therefore ſaid to be born of God.</p>
                     <p>The third benefit of the Spirit, in them to whom he is ſent, is an union or conjunction with Chriſt, whereby we are made his members,

As for meekneſſe, it is, when by injurious and raſh dealing a man is provoked, and yet he neither intends nor attempts a revenging requital. As for temperance, it is a bridling of our appetite in meat, drink, or apparel. 1.

Expoſtulate then, can you find in your hearts an utter diſlike of ſin, becauſe it is ſin, and a godly ſorrow for it? Can you find in your hearts, a forſaking of ſin, ſeconded with a fixt reſolution of yielding obedience to the Divine Ordinances of God? Can you find in your hearts, an avoiding of all occaſions, that may miniſter matter of offending God, with an unſatisfied deſire to be at peace and unity with him? then the Spirit of his Son is ſent into our hearts.</p>
                     <p>The fifth benefit confer'd on thoſe, on whom the Spirit is confer'd, is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort, which none can take away from them, conceived in them in the time of their greateſt extremity; hence the Spirit is called <hi>the Comforter:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 14.16.</note> Our Saviour told his Diſciples, <hi>that he would ſend them another Comforter that ſhould remain with them for ever.</hi> Hence again he is call'd <hi>Oleum laetitiae, the oyle of gladneſſe,</hi> he cheareth the heart of man, by raiſing up his dead ſpirits, and making him to rejoyce in the Lord. The cauſes of our ſorrow are either outward calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or a troubled conſcience, in both which the Comforter takes away our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and begetteth joy. We read of the Apoſtles, that after Chriſt aſcended, they fled from place to place, and hid themſelves for fear of the ſpiteful Jews: But as ſoon as they received the holy Ghoſt, they were as bold as Lions; they preach't Chriſt crucified in publick, they impartially reproved ſin to the full, and taking heart of grace, <hi>did rejoyce that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt.</hi> Hence did proceed that heroick ſpirit that Hiſtory reports to be in thoſe Martyrs, which ſpilt their blood for him, that ſpilt his blood for them. 'Tis not the face of man could daunt them, their inward comfort did far exceed their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tribulation; and though their bodies periſht by external violence, yet ſo great was their ſpiritual conſolation, that they felt no pain. In like manner, when any of the faithful are through extreme poverty brought low, and thereby brought into contempt in the world, yet they comfort themſelves in the providence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God that can never fail; inſomuch as that all calamities he what they will, cannot deprive them of their inward comfort. Nor yet a troubled conſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, though an unſupportable burden, for then when their conſciences are troubled, the Spirit labours to reſtore them to the joyes of their ſalvation, by ſtirring up faith in them apprehending Chriſt, and with him the remiſſion of ſin, puriſying their hearts and conſciences from dead works, aſſuring them that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is made in heaven, <hi>and that there is now no condemnation unto them;</hi> than which, there cannot be a greater comfort in this world.</p>
                     <p>Phyſitians have obſerved in the heart two motions, the one is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, a conſtriction or cloſing up of the heart: Spiritual Phyſitians may obſerve the ſame in their hearts, where the Spirit of God takes up his manſion. <hi>My heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, is enlarged,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with thoſe comforts and joyes, which the Spirit that inhabits there begets there, and none elſe: And the heart is cloſed up again againſt the receiving or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining all worldly ſorrow, which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>cauſeth death;</hi> and keeps within it ſelf the joy of the holy Ghoſt; hence the hearts of the faithful may be ſaid to be full, full of joy, full of the holy Ghoſt, full of life; for <hi>God ſends forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt benefit whereby the Spirits preſence is noted in our hearts, is, the ſtrength, valour and livelihood, whereby we go on in the Spirit, fighting a good fight againſt the enemies of our ſalvation, and finiſhing our courſe with joy. We hear of an order of Knights, called Knights of the holy Ghoſt; of this order are all the faithful, that undertake Chriſtian warfare, and fight the combates of Jeſus Chriſt; all that maintain the profeſſion of the truth in ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart; all that with hearty reſolutions begin and proſecute the ruine of the Romiſh Synagogue, the diſſolution of their ſuperſtitious worſhips, whereſoever, within
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52564:220"/>the limits of their juriſdiction. Of this order are all thoſe Chriſtians, that behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſins, lay hold on Chriſts merits and Gods mercy, by an unmovable faith; for this hold is taken by the ſtrength of Gods Spirit, wherewith he doth endow us. Of this order are all thoſe who reſiſt the temptations of Satan, the provocations of the fleſh, the alluring vanities of this periſhing world; theſe are all vanquiſht by the power of the moſt high, that rules in our hearts. Of this order are all thoſe who are content to ſacrifice their lives for the Name of Chriſt, that ſo they may be found in him; ſtout hearts have they and full of ſpirit, that ſpurn at the preſent pleaſures and commodities, dignities of this world; and are content to part with all hopes of theſe and all that he hath, for the glorious hope of eternal life, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed unto them with the precious blood of the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Such a ſpirit as this, no worldling can be partaker of, and ſuch a ſpirit as this, we read to have been in Martyrs, even at the ſtake. To conclude this point, Of this order are all ſuch, as in their greateſt neceſſities and moſt deſperate extremities, acknowledge and rely on the gracious protection and fatherly Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who againſt all hope reſt in hope, which is as much (as one ſaith) as for a man to ſhake the whole earth, and is as hard a work. Hence by reaſon that the Spirit doth communicate this ſtrength unto us, he is called the Spirit of ſtrength; thus his <hi>strength is ſhewn in our weakneſſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 11.2.</note> whereby great and difficult matters beyond expectation, or the reach of our nature, are brought to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>All theſe are ſufficient reſtimonies, whereby we may undoubedly and ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that where they are to be found, Gods Spirit it is to be found; <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts.</hi>

                     <p>Wherefore (my dearly beloved, into whoſe hearts the Spirit of God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred) make it appear by his holy converſation that he is in your hearts: if ye live in the Spirit,

As they that have no ſoul, have no natural life; ſo, they have not ſpiritual life, that have not the Spirit. Let therefore your life be ſuch, as that all may take notice of what ſpirit ye are, and that the Spirit is in your hearts; that ſo you by your works, and others by your example, <hi>may glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi>

                     <p>The graces of the Spirit are likened to ſparks of fire, which a little water may ſoone quench; <hi>take heed that ye quench not the Spirit in you, by drinking up iniquity like water;</hi> for hereby as ye deprive your ſelves of the Spirit, ſo of all ſpiritual bleſſings and heavenly comforts, which redound unto us by his comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fellowſhip; by which, as we are guided into all truth in this life, ſo after this life, go into the joyes of our Maſter, which is in heaven.</p>
                     <p>When I do ſeriouſly conſider with my ſelfe the great love of God, extended without all deſert unto the ſinful ſons of men; I am carried away with a ſtrong admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof. I ſee men plung'd in the depth of miſery, I ſee God viewing them in the height of mercy; the extremity of our miſery moving God to pity. Our captivity unto Satan had been endleſs; had not God of his infinite goodneſs ſent forth his Son to bring us forth. We were for ever ſold under ſin without redemption, had not God ſent forth his Son to redeem us, to have bought us with his precious blood.

And becauſe thus ſons, behold a further pledge of his never failing-favour to us, <hi>he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, Crying, Abba Father.</hi>

                     <p>So that upon the Spirit of God confer'd, is confer'd the gift of prayer: for in whoſe hearts he dwels, he is not idle, neither is he as that ſpirit that Chriſt did caſt out of the man in the Goſpel, dumbe, a dumbe ſpirit; but a crying ſpirit: not that the ſpirit properly cryes <hi>Abba Father,</hi> for God the Father is not the Father of the ſpirit, but of the Son, and the beginning or fountain from whom as alſo from the Son the Spirit doth proceed; but that it makes them in whom he ever is, to be ever crying, <hi>Abba Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein is to be obſerved,

                     <p>This crying, is praying; and not every kind of praying, but a vehement and ardent praying, with all the affections and powers of the ſoul aſſembled together, whereby the deſires of our hearts are made known unto the God of heaven; the ſoules voice is drawn up to the height. Thus our Saviour in the dayes of his fleſh is ſaid to have offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears,

Hence proceed thoſe groanes in the children of God when their ſpeech fails them, which are the onely meſſengers of their thoughts, and they are ſaid to be the ſpirits groanings in their hearts, whereby interceſſion is made for them. They are called unſpeakable groans; unſpeakable (ſay ſome) for their greatneſs, and ſo indeed they are; great in the ears of God: unſpeakable (ſay others) by reaſon of their weakneſs, cauſed either by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes, or inward preſſures of the ſoul; expreſſions they are certainly of a good heart, liſted up to God; and though weak, proceeding from the ſpecial inſtinct and proper motion of the Spirit of prayer. And albeit they be weak and confuſed in the hearts of Gods children, ſo that they themſelves can hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or utter them in themſelves;
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.27.</note> yet God, who is the ſearcher of the hidden things of the heart, knows the mind and meaning of the Spirit: ſo that by the cryes, ſigh's or ſobs to God never ſo ſmall, and in a manner inſenſible and ſeeble like the ſaint pulſe at the hour of death; yet if they thereby, by the Spirit make requeſts unto God, it ſhall be heard of him: and albeit thoſe things which they ſigh after be not alwayes manifeſtly and (the Spirit moving thereunto) diſtinctly ſeen of them; yet God who is infinite in knowledge doth perceive their deſires, or rather the deſires of the Spirit in them. This mental crying is not common to all, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the children of the regeneration;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3.</note> without which, <hi>none can</hi> hardly <hi>call God Father; as none can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next kind of crying is that which is only vocal, conſiſting only of words. Thus Hypocrites cry and pray, for faſhion, not for conſcience ſake, <hi>Vox &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria nihil,</hi> all voice, no hearts; they can cry loud enough in a Phariſaical pride,

                        <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> and none ſhall ſtop their mouths, but ſuch heartleſſe Chriſtians ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Theſe are they <hi>that draw near unto the Lord with their mouth, and with their lips do honour him, but have removed their heart far from him,</hi> as he complains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. This is (ſaith one) <hi>Precationis inane ſimulachrum,</hi> and in truth that prayer or cry which is only a lip-labour, not proceeding from the heart, <hi>is but as ſounding braſſe, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cymbal;</hi> it is like the Play called the <hi>Motions;</hi> wherein though there is motion, yet no life; and although there be never ſo glorious and pompous obſervation of outward ceremonies, and in that complemental manner only come before God, and offer up their prayers unto him; yet ſhall they have the repulſe for their vain oſtentation. Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the firſt, the Lord ſpeaking of the hypocritial Jews, that were curious in the external worſhip and ſervice of God, and would ſeem to preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing, therefore profeſſeth unto them (becauſe their ſervices were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the heart) that when they made many prayers he would not hear them. And the ſame Prophet, <hi>Cap.</hi> 64.7. in effect calls ſuch prayers no prayers, when as be ſaith, There is none that calleth upon the name of God; he that cryes not to God with his whole heart, cryes not at all to God; for he that worſhips God, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth; not in bare formalities. This kind of crying is but a vain beating of the aire, is anothing available, whereof the Spirit is no author; and unleſs the Spirit cry in the heart, there can be no true, but a falſe crying, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains yet a third kind of crying or praying, <hi>viz.</hi> both mental and vocal; wherein both the heart and the voice are directed to God; the mind and the mouth both conſonant, both jump together; here out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh: And this is that pure language which the Lord ſpeaking by the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi> ſaid, that he would turn to the people, that they might all call upon the name of the Lord. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> advertiſeth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 3.7. Cap. 14.2. <hi>Nec lecta, neé neglecta.</hi> Pſal. 77.1.</note> to take to them words, and to turn to the Lord; that is, ſuch words as may make a true report unto God, of their hearty converſion to him, and lively ſaith in him. Thus ſaith, <hi>David, I cryed unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice, and he gave ear unto me.</hi> Such a cry as is this, is no falſe alarum, but a true teſtimony of a ſanctified ſoul, of our confidence in him, and is ever powerful with God. <hi>The prayer of the faithful availeth much,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> for it is framed and compoſed by the admirable Art of the Spirit of God in their hearts, ere it be uttered with the tongue: The voice then reflecting on the heart, the heart is made more zealous; and then what is ſaid of fame, may be ſaid of it, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ires acquirit eundo;</hi> it gathers ſtrength in the uttering. Let your voice therefore in prayer be conformed and correſpond to the affections and wiſhes of your hearts, that they may run together, and let the affections and wiſhes of your hearts be guided by the Holy Ghoſt which if ye do, it is without all contradiction a moſt certain Argument, that God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the act of crying, I paſſe to the object, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that we are the ſont of God.</hi> This teſtification of the Spirit in our hearts, who is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble informer of the things that are given us of God, makes to cry, <hi>Abba, Father:</hi> For we can never call God Father, except we be firſt informed and perſwaded by the Spirit that we are the ſons of God.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrew or Syriack word <hi>Abba,</hi> and the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The gemination here <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> which is Father, Father, noteth the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection and vehement zeal of Gods children in crying and praying unto the Father of Spirits; their prayers are preſſing and urgent cries, and never ſatisfied until heard; which ardency of theirs is grounded, 1. Upon the ſence of their wants; neceſſity conſtrains them to uſe all earneſtneſſe in their own behalf; they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52564:222"/>muſt knock hard, they muſt ſeek hard, they muſt cry hard, Father, Father; ere they ſhall be heard, or their ſuits obtained. 2. Upon the knowledge of their own inſufficiency and diſability of furniſhing themſelves with corporal neceſſaries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the body, or ſpiritual bleſſings and habiliments pertaining to the ſoul: They know, that the bleſſings of this life and the life to come, muſt come from their Father which is in heaven. 3. Upon Gods willingneſſe and readineſſe to do them all the good he can. He is faithful in promiſing, and as faithful in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The word <hi>Abbah,</hi> ſignifieth to be willing, from whence God hath this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation: a father is willing to protect his child from all dangers, and to relieve him upon all occaſions; and although juſt cauſe of anger be offered him, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in time will work it out: Even ſuch is the tender affection of our heavenly Father, known to his beloved ſons, that they are hereby the more emboldened to proſecute what they would have brought to paſſe. They have his heart to be ſet upon them, his eares alwayes to be open unto them, his eyes continually watching over them, his beſt wiſhes ever with them, and all his bleſſings reſerved for them. Theſe are encouragements for them to approach unto him, who is more forward to give unto themall things, than they themſelves to demand any thing.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paſſe, that coming unto him, as unto our Father, we come boldly, we may come confidently; there is nothing more requiſite than to put on a good face, and a good courage, when we ſue to God No denial muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the firſt entrance, for this were too dejected puſillanimity.

                        <hi>come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we obtain mercy and find grace in time of need.</hi> God hath erected a throne of grace, where he ſits to receive and to hear all ſuits directed unto him for mercy: He hath a Court for mercy as well as for juſtice; where humane merits muſt not be pleaded, but Gods mercy above all advanced: if then any child of God who hath been prodigal in miſ-ſpending what God hath given him, come but to him in the time of need, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly bold; he ſhall return with a contented mind, and ſhall find reſt ſufficient for his ſoul. This may be term'd a holy preſumption.</p>
                     <p>Upon whom ſhould children preſume, if not upon their parents? Upon whom ſhould we be bold, if not upon our provident Creator? What father of the fleſh will give his children a ſtone for bread, or for fiſh a Serpent? If our fleſhly parents know how to give good things to their children when they ask of them, how much more knoweth our heavenly Father to confer good things to them that rely upon his Providence and cry to him? Since therefore we have free acceſſe to God, cry with all boldneſſe unto him, who will proſper our endeavours, and like an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent father fill us with good things, and will not return us empty away.</p>
                     <p>We may come confidently with aſſured perſwaſion of his favor and lenity; the very name of Father is of force enough, to repel out of our minds all diffidence. Chriſt hath obtained this boon for us at the hands of God, that we ſhall have what we ask in his Name: <hi>What things ſoever</hi> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.24.) <hi>ye deſire when ye pray; believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> The Lord,

                     <p>As there is a Spirit of truth, ſo there is a ſpirit of lying. God is ſaid <hi>to put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of the falſe Prophets.</hi> But here ſpirits of lying lye in the very hearts of ſome imaginary Apoſtles, that blatter out they know not what againſt <hi>Paul;</hi> but he graced and ſtrengthened with the Spirit and grace of God, would not be nonpluſt or put to ſilence with ſuch facility, he had ſpirit enough to oppoſe the falſe allegations of theſe deceitful brethren, who endeavoured to pervert the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> to bring them from Chriſtianity to Judaiſme; maintaining that circumciſion and other ceremonies of the law were to be retained, as neceſſary to ſalvation. Alledging alſo that <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine was no true doctrine in all points; and what he had, he had received from the Apoſtles at the ſecond hand as well as they; and therefore they teaching one thing, and he another quite contrary to what they taught, what reaſon had they to believe him more than them; more in number? But the Apoſtle in this chapter clears himſelf from the ſcandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of theſe inſinuating Cavillers, as we may ſee by taking a brief ſurvey of the chapter which may guide us unto <hi>Paul</hi>'s journey.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he was an Apoſtle himſelf. The people ſaid of King <hi>Saul, is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> So ſaid the people of this <hi>Saul,</hi> now <hi>Paul,</hi> is not this he that perſecuted the Church of God extreamly? what? is <hi>Paul</hi> alſo among the Apoſtles? But now no more perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, not of the Apoſtles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, not of men, neither by man; why? by whom then? but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Firſt then, he was an Apoſtle of Gods making.</p>
                     <p>As for his doctrine, it was the Goſpel, he ſpake nothing but Goſpel, that which in time paſt he perſecuted; no other than that the Apoſtles preached, and Chriſt taught the Apoſtles. Hence he comes with a curſe, anathematizing them that offer to preach any other Goſpel, be he man or Angel. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>As for his teachers who they were, that he anſwers in a word, not man but God;

And to what end was he called? that is, briefly, <hi>to reveale his Son in him,</hi> that he might do the like unto others; <hi>To reveale his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles. verſ.</hi> 16. When he was thus called, <hi>he confer'd not with fleſh and blood,</hi> as too too weak to teach him, he would not build on the ſandy foundations of mans braine, that ſhakes like a quagmire; he would ſurer, or none at all; <hi>I confer'd not with fleſh and blood.</hi> I, but ſome might except againſt that, that he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was converſant with the Apoſtles, and ſo learned the Goſpel by hear-ſay. Nay, that's a lye; <hi>neither went I up to Jeruſalem to them which were Apoſtles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned into Damaſcus.</hi> He went not up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> indeed ſo ſuddenly, but three years after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he went thither to ſee <hi>Peter, and abode with him fifteen dayes.</hi> In the firſt three years ſpace of his converſion he ſaw not an Apoſtle, but when three years were paſt, which was the matter of five or ſixe years after the Paſſion of our Saviour, the laſt year of the reigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Caligula's,</hi> he went up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>All theſe prove manifeſtly, that the Goſpel was not revealed unto him by fleſh and blood, whether thoſe of his own Nation or the Apoſtles; but onely <hi>by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then after three years]</hi> that is, when three years were expired after his inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Not ſeeing ſo much as an Apoſtle, much leſſe hearing, in preaching the Goſpel up and down <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In <hi>Arabia</hi>] If <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy, made now more happy by the Goſpel; if <hi>Arabia</hi> the ſtony, mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the ſtony hearts of the inhabitants; if <hi>Arabia</hi> the deſart, Chriſt takes poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it by <hi>Paul</hi> his meſſenger. Three years did he continue preaching the Goſpel in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> ere he came to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle we ſee yields an account of his time ſpending, both of years and of days; to teach all, eſpecially the Miniſters of Gods Word, to keep an account of their time. This is the doctrine in general drawn from the example of the Apoſtle, That we muſt have a care how we ſpend our time; that it be not conſumed in trivial affairs, matters of no weight, of no conſequence; but on high and profound matters; ſuch as well as belong to our everlaſting ſalvation, as thoſe of our ordinary calling. God hath appointed that every man ſhould have a double calling, one reſpecting God, another man. The firſt without the laſt cannot be, the laſt without the firſt may be, but miſerable. Our ſervice unto God ſanctifies the creatures ſervice unto us. And as we cannot be without the firſt, except we turn Atheiſts; ſo not without the laſt, except we turn beaſts. A Chriſtian, of all other hath moſt to do, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many improvements of reaſon, ſo many reaſons of faith, which is above reaſon; had he no other calling, he of all other hath leaſt reaſon to be idle. And that for theſe reaſons.</p>

                     <p>The book of nature doth furniſh with a knowledge of the power and wiſdom of a moſt powerful of a moſt wiſe God, in time: hence time makes a perfect huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. God gives us a head for contemplation, hands for action, and time for all things. In this book of nature there are delivered unto us Principles of morality,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52564:224"/>God gave us time enough to learn them; but we through ſin made it ſhort, and our ſelves forget him, his and our ſelves; and therefore he writ the moral law rather in tables of ſtone, than in the table of our hearts, as more faithful regiſters of his Law, and withal to ſhew that our hearts are harder than ſtones. Stones ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ravings in time, our hearts never; therefore our hearts being ſo hard, God muſt raiſe himſelf children out of ſtones. Hence comes counſel, and action, and an underſtanding heart, all in good time.</p>
                     <p>There is a book called the book of God, out of which Miniſters are to preach the Word, and to <hi>be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> To preach with <hi>Paul;</hi> to pray daily with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Centurion of the Italian band; to conferre like <hi>Philip</hi> with the Eunuch, Treaſurer to <hi>Candao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Queen; and to be always in action. The calling teacheth them, to be ſtill calling of men to repent and beleeve.

                     <p>Another reaſon is, if we conſider our brittle eſtate, the ſhortneſs of our life-time. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Here we are clad with clods of dirt, our mud-wals begin to moulder in our conception. Our whole life is but an active death. Earth we were, earth we are, and to earth we ſhall, muſt returne; God, not we, can tell how ſoon.

                     <p>Another reaſon is, if we conſider what advantage the grand enemy of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Satan, gets by our idleneſſe. Then is his only time to clap wicked ſuggeſtions into our hearts. When we are moſt idle, than the devil is as buſie as a butler about us: then doth he make an aſſault with his wicked ſpirits, hell's black guards to tempt us to under go this or that deviliſh complot. When our minds are wandring in the ayre, we know not where nor what about, the devil enters in. True it is, there is a time for all things, but no time to be idle. <hi>A time to be born,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> a time to dy; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heale; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refraine from embracing; a time to get, and a time to loſe; a time to keep, and a time to caſt away; a time to rent, and a time to ſow; a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak; a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of warre, and a time of peace:</hi> here time is not loſt, but all theſe times well uſed in their time, the Devil hath no time to tempt us, ſin hath no time to over-power us.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt; <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>teach me ſo to number my dayes, that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52564:225"/>mine heart unto wiſdom.</hi> God gives a number of dayes, but few number them, or make account of them; but I fear it is becauſe few know how to number them; this therefore I ſhew briefly; To number our dayes, is to conſider the miſery which we purchaſed to our ſelves by the evil of ſin, the evil of guilt, the evil of puniſhment. It is to make a recapitulation, or take a juſt account or ſumme of all the ungodly acts we have committed, as neere as we can, in thought, word and deed. It is to look narrowly into the crooked paſſages of our lives, to ſee what we have omitted in Gods ſervice, and what we have committed againſt him, that we may mend what is amiſſe. We muſt come to our tryal every day, which is called <hi>Examen Pythagoricum;</hi> thus we become more wiſe every day than other.</p>
                     <p>Hence we muſt take a note of all our impious acts, and ſummom them up in the Court in our hearts, to appear before conſcience as Judge; which if it play the honeſt Judge, condemnes us, racks us. This done, we are pincht with a ſenſe of our miſery, cauſing us to run with all ſpeed to God for his mercy. Hard and ſtony are their conſciences that make no conſcience, no reckoning of numbring their years or days; they caſt up one groſſe ſin on another in groſſe; they adde, they multiply; never ſubduct, never divide: But he that learns <hi>Davids</hi> Arithmetick, which is <hi>Ars bene numerandi,</hi> the Art of numbring well all his ill, is a good Artiſt, divides, ſubducts and caſts away all ſin; reſerves nothing in his mind; but adds vertue to vertue, multiplies one good deed on the head of another: he remembers Gods Ordinance <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini,</hi> increaſe and multiply, as well in grace as in other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes. Make we but a due computation of our daily actions, we ſhall find a tincture of ſin that cannot be ſeparated: Prie we into our thoughts, the imaginations and purpoſes of mans heart <hi>are only evil continually:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> Examine we our words, we ſhall find that our tongues oſt over-run our wits, our wits wiſdom: Obſerve we our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſins, whereby we get a kind of dexterity in Rhetorical repetition of the ſame ſins; we ſhall ſmell out in our hearts a den of theeves. Habits are acquired by continual actions; ſo that ſinful actions make rank ſinners. Thoſe that continue this cuſtome of ſinning, without <hi>numbring their dayes, that they may apply their hearts unto wiſdom,</hi> are like to make a fair reckoning at the years end, the end of their dayes: but he that would prevent all miſchief, muſt make a profeſſion of making a daily inquiſition, and caſting up all thoſe fractions of the Law of God, that God may make him whole upon confeſſion. This ſhould be our daily work thus to number our dayes; neither is it to any end, except it be continued to the end of our dayes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We muſt <hi>redeem the time, for the dayes are evil,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. A forcible reaſon,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> I promiſe you: We are to make the beſt we can of our time, becauſe the dayes are evil. In evil dayes, we muſt do good d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y-deeds; and out of evil draw good, as God out of darkneſs drew light. If we redeem not the time, we caſt away our ſelves like Caſt-aways without redemption. Now would we know what it is to redeem the time? It is only to take time while time ſerves, to ſerve our turn. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a <hi>Manichee</hi> nine years; he took his time to turn bias another way for the good of Gods Church. <hi>Luther</hi> was a Monk a long time; but he ſhortned the time by redeeming it; he found after that he had done nothing, when he thought he had done ſomething worth the doing. <hi>Paul</hi> was a blaſphemous Perſecutor of the Chriſtian Church; but he in time redeemed the time, and proved a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel of grace. <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>Vespaſian</hi> never thought the day well ſpent, wherein he had not done ſome work of charity. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Younger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd daily with the learned Biſhops of his time, whereof his Court was full. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor did delight always to do good works of piety and religion. Idle creatures think the time tedious; but thoſe that are taken up in ſerious affairs, eſpecially of Salvation, think the time to paſs away too ſoon. No time too ſoon to do good; for to do good, is always high time. Therefore to pretermit no occaſion, (which once paſt, there is no looking for it after) no time of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God requires, and avoiding what God diſallows, is to redeem the time, and to make evil days good days for us; our beſt days.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe then may juſtly be reproved, who neither <hi>number their days,</hi> nor <hi>redeem
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52564:225"/>the time:</hi> They run on the ſcore till the day of payment come; then they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed through ſin, and found unable to ſatisfie or pay God; God pays them home with a witneſs. And theſe are ſuch as betake themſelves to no lawful Calling; but calling for alms, they live rambling up and down like catholick or univerſal men, upon every mans devotion, or at every mans elbow; who ſcarce ever call upon God, but <hi>for Gods ſake</hi> on man. Theſe are Common Beggars. But I paſs by theſe without any more adoe.</p>
                     <p>Again, They are worthy to be reproved, who neglect the affairs of their general or particular Calling, or both, to follow their Pleaſures altogether. God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a Garden, as well for action as for contemplation; as well to buſie himſelf about the dreſſing of it, as to recreate himſelf in it. <hi>Praeſtat otioſum eſſe, quàm nihil agere;</hi> 'tis true, it is better indeed to do ſomething, though it be nothing to the purpoſe, than to do nothing at all: What needs either? <hi>Nero</hi> will cage himſelf up in a Cloſet to catch Flies, rather than do nothing; but, <hi>hoc aliquid nihil eſt,</hi> this doing is as good as do nothing; for haply they are acting that which the Devil would tempt them unto, had they been with <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard altogether wrapt up in idleneſs. This cannot excuſe them. The fellow that we read of in the Goſpel, that married newly, he was buſie at home with his wife, he could not come to do what he ſhould have done; <hi>I am married, I cannot come;</hi> but that excuſed him not: The company that were invited to a feaſt, were otherwiſe imployed; but that excuſed them not. No pleaſure, no buſineſs ſhould keep us from performing what God requires. When God bids us do one thing, what have we to do, to do another? He will come upon us, as he did on the Jewes, with a <hi>Quis rogavis?
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> Who required this at your hands?</hi> Do what God bids; and what is done at Gods bidding, cannot be done amiſs.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſort to be reprehended, Thoſe that do nothing but plot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that watch their opportunity to catch men napping: Theſe are the limbs of the Devil, ſcholars of his own bringing up. They <hi>take time,</hi> but 'tis to do evil; They <hi>watch,</hi> but never <hi>pray to God;</hi> They are always <hi>doing,</hi> but 'tis <hi>iniquity.</hi> No more of theſe <hi>Gains,</hi> who are all upon the point of eternal condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Others are to be condemned, who ſofter and cocker up themſelves in Idleneſs; that do not ſo much as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>pick ſtraws.</hi> God breathes into men the breath of life; Idle men, <hi>Prodigi temporis,</hi> unthriſty husbands of Time, make a ſhift to breathe it out again, and care not how. God gives life; ſo that life is the gift of God; and he that ſpends not his life well, ſhall anſwer well for it. God allows them no mear, that labour not for it: <hi>He that laboureth not, ſhall not eat.</hi> Firſt ſweat, then eat. But many call daily for <hi>daily bread,</hi> who ſeek not how to deſerve it.</p>
                     <p>And here I come to our ſelves. It is not for us to ſit all day long in our Studies, like <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Tub, for faſhion ſake, to keep up our credits, and to get unto our ſelves the name of painful Students, except we apply our ſtudies in good earneſt: They that uſe that trick, do not ſo much keep their Studies, as their Studies keep them. Our brains ſhould ſweat in contemplation, our hands in action; and not like the ſluggard, hand over head or under. <hi>A little more ſleep,</hi> expecting the good time of the day to be told them by the Bell. I may ſay more truly of them, than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid of the Iſraelites, <hi>They are idle, they are idle.</hi> It is as great folly in them, who becauſe they cannot be idle at home, they will gad abroad (like <hi>Dinah</hi>) and there he idle, and loſe their virginity, I mean the flower of their youth; and ſo for a <hi>Six days ſomething,</hi> they will bring you home a <hi>Six days nothing,</hi> except it be a full belly and an empty brain, like Epicures; as for the <hi>Seventh day,</hi> they may reſt by Law. I ſpeak no more, but their caſe is miſerable. They may know, and know much; but this is all they can attain to know, to know that they know nothing. And for this improficiencie, God will ſay, as it was ſaid of <hi>Judas, Let another take his place.</hi> I ſpeak in way of prevention: <hi>Dii talem nobit averti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52564:226"/>That take Duties, but never do their Duties. If they preach four times in a year, or now and then, they think that fair; whether they be there, or no, any other time, it makes no matter: When they ſhould be preſent among them always, teaching by their own Example, as by dumb Sermons. Or if they get others to ſupply their turns, all is huſht up, as if all were well. But <hi>Paul</hi> preached, as it is probable, three years in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and lived there all that while. Be ye (beloved Brethren) O be ye, when God calls you unto that Calling abroad, followers of him, as he was of Chriſt Jeſus! I may tax more ſin; but this is enough for a taſte of ſo four ſauce.</p>
                     <p>As for you that count Time precious, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people.</hi> You that number and redeem your days and years, with S. <hi>Paul</hi> here; I do ſay, you are happy for making uſe of your time, in ſearching out your ſins, and repenting for them when you have done. God conſidered his created <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>ſaw that it was good;</hi> to teach us to conſider our offenſive Darkneſs, and ſee that it is naught. We muſt ſearch every corner of our hearts narrowly, as God is ſaid to ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a candle.</p>
                     <p>All that I have hitherto ſpoken tends to this, To teach us to forſake our ſins, and to give our ſelves to the works of our Vocation.

But to apply our ſelves to ſound doctrine, and to avoid vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as the Apoſtle exhorts us. Suffer therefore (Ye ſons of Light) the words of exhortation. I doubt not but ſome are troubled with the queſtion, <hi>Viri fratréſque, quid faciemus? Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Number and redeem your four years, your ſeven years time, all your time more or leſs, that none may find holes in your coat. Do ſomething every day; go from one point to another, and ſtand not upon points with others. Run with the Time; <hi>Apelles</hi> like, <hi>Nulla dies ſine linea,</hi> Let no day paſs thy head without ſome line. Let the line of thy Calling run parallel along with the line of the Day. Thus may you <hi>learn line upon line, precept upon precept, until you be perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This remedy will cure the ſymptoms of ignorance and ſin, <hi>(My life for yours.)</hi> Idleneſs is the worſt thing of a thouſand; <hi>Inficit, interficit;</hi> Affect it not, leſt it infect you, it kill you.

                     <p>I need preſs this no further, but take example by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching three years, that ye may give the like account of your time with a ſafe conſcience. Do as S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> Matrons were uſed to do, contend who ſhould get moſt Scripture by heart. Again, Satan we know will beſiege us: therefore as we victual our ſelves twice a day, or oftner, to gather ſtrength againſt bodily death; the leaſt we can is twice (if not oftner, the oftner the better) to victual our ſelves againſt our ſpiritual enemies, that threaten death to our ſouls. This is our comfort, that we know the beſt of our defences, (God;) and the worſt of our enemies power, (Satan's) Let us not therefore fear the worſt of our enemies power, (Satan's,) while we know the beſt of our defences, (God.) Let us ſo carry our ſelves, that none carry us away. <hi>Quid ſtatis otioſi?</hi> ſaid the Lord of the Vineyard, <hi>Why ſtand ye idle?</hi> So ſay I, <hi>Quid ſtamus otioſi?</hi> To what end ſtand we idle? as if we had nothing to do. Let our firſt time be our worſt time, our laſt the beſt. Think that time loſt, wherein we do not think on God. Thus may we carry an upright Conſcience, made able and at all times ready to yield a good account of our years, moneths, days and hours, to friend or ſoe. If to friend, to comfort them; if to foe, to confute them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did here the falſe Apoſtles. And thus much for the firſt part of theſe words, <hi>Then after three years.</hi>

                     <p> It follows, <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem.</hi> This is his journey: He grants here that he went up, not commanded, not ſent for, but of his own accord unbidden. Here the moral and natural action agree together in the intent of the Agent; He went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not to learn any thing, but to ſee <hi>Peter.</hi> That which <hi>Luke</hi> makes mention of in the 9. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when <hi>Barnabas</hi> preſented him to the reſt of the Apoſtles, acquainting them with <hi>Pauls</hi> paſſages in and ſince his converſion, how he ſaw the Lord in the high-way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and how he had ſpoken with him, and that he had preached in the name of Chriſt with audacity there unto them, whom he went with letters to apprehend; ſhews plainly that he received not the Goſpel of the Apoſtles, neither was he compelled to teach the Goſpel according to preſcript of the Apoſtles. They were afraid of him at the firſt ſight, until after a further and more deliberate trial.</p>
                     <p>I will not inſiſt hereon; but I proceed to the intent, or the impulſive cauſe of this his Peregrination; which was, to ſee <hi>Peter.</hi> Actions of reaſonable creatures, are to be allowed or diſallowed, according to the intents of the Agents. Therefore I join all three in commiſſion; <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem, to ſee Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole marrow of the matter lies in theſe words, <hi>[to ſee Peter:]</hi> ſhewing moſt expreſly, that he came not to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to better his knowledge; for he had before received the Goſpel fully from Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> was not his maſter, nor he <hi>Peter's</hi> ſcholar; he onely came to ſee him, to ſalute him, or congratulate him, as his Coadjutor in the Goſpel; as alſo to manifeſt unto the company of Apoſtles what he was, and to clear himſelf for a falſe opinion that ſome put of him,
<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> and how for the matter of doctrine there was no diſagreement between them and him.</p>
                     <p>And here <hi>Hierom</hi> wittily flouts at the flim-flams of Pope <hi>Clement;</hi> who ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to behold <hi>Peters</hi> eyes, cheeks and countenance, to ſee whether he were macilent or fat, whether his noſe were crooked or even ſet, whether his forehead were covered with hair, and whether he had a bald pate or no. Certainly (ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi>) he thought to find <hi>Peter</hi> a God, not a man. This is but bald ſtuff, all Popiſh foppery.</p>
                     <p>But here we ſee what love ſhould be betwixt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to be careful of one anothers health. The love he had to the goſpel, made him to viſit <hi>Peter.</hi> Religion and love joins hearts together; and that is a religious love: And where Religion makes an oppoſition, hearts muſt not admit a conjunction. Both in this are fearful aſpects. <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem, to ſee Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s a good deed of him; therefore I make this collection, <hi>That ſome kind of Peregrination or Pilgrimage is lawful.</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> with all his family went down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſee <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through fire and water, to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> So the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> went to ſee King <hi>Solomon.</hi> So <hi>Paul Peter,</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſons may be theſe: Becauſe that their love may be ſeen, by <hi>greeting with a holy kiſs.</hi> And becauſe it increaſeth joy. Hearts meet with mouths, at the meeting of friends. It diſpels all miſts of conceived ſorrow. <hi>John</hi> leapt in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers womb, at the ſalutation of the Virgin, becauſe Chriſt was there. And without all doubt, this bred a great comfort in <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſee <hi>Paul</hi> converted to</p>
                     <p>Now in that I ſaid, that ſome Peregrination is lawful; it follows that there is another unlawful, and that is Popiſh Pilgrimage, by Vow, or impoſition of Popiſh Impoſtors. Papiſts out of theſe words collect a twofold doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Pilgrimage to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and other ſuch devoted places, is a religious work, and merits heaven. They ground upon this example of the Apoſtle; <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem.</hi> Their ſecond doctrine, a main pillar of their Religion, is this; That <hi>Peter</hi> had the ſupremacie of <hi>Paul:</hi> Their reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> here went to ſee <hi>Peter.</hi> But I hope it was not (as one ſaith) to kiſs his feet, as if he were Pope.</p>
                     <p>The firſt argues but a piece of poor Papiſtical Logick; out of one particular act of one man, to draw a general rule. Secondly, to make a rule of Religion, in a thing where there is no ſuch thing intended. Here Papiſts take their mark amiſs, and therefore miſs the mark of truth.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, in the Old Teſtament there was an appointed place, whither the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52564:227"/>were bound to reſort to worſhip God; as we may ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. They were to hold three feaſts; they were to go to one certain place three times in the year at theſe three feaſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Three times in a year ſhall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he ſhall chuſe; In the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feaſt of weeks, and in the feaſt of tabernacles;</hi> that is, the feaſt of the Paſſover, the feaſt of Weeks, and the feaſt of Tabernacles. Now this place was firſt where the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes</hi> was; and ſo we read how <hi>Elkanah</hi> with his two wives went out of his city to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where the Tabernacle then was, to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> This continued for the ſpace of four hundred ſeventy eight years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, unto the time of King <hi>Solomon.</hi> Then after the Temple was built at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Templum Domini,</hi> the Temple of the Lord; all came thither. Yea, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, that they came from all places to the feaſt of Unleavened bread; then all of them were killed to the number of Eleven hundred thouſand <hi>Jews;</hi> they came when they ſhould not come. But now the Sun is come to the Meridian, there is no ſhadow; that Law is aboliſhed, the places then appointed are quite brought to ruine; theſe were only types of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Again, God commanded that for his honor; the Pope (in his own and Papiſts conceit, a little diminutive god, but a great man) commanded this for his profit. But God gave an <hi>Item</hi> for this,
<note place="margin">Deus non ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitione coli vult ſed pictate.</note> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Fruſtra me colunt,</hi> In vain do they worſhip me: It is not commanded in any part of the New Teſtament, and therefore no part of Gods honor. More than this, It is againſt the Scripture, being meer Idolatry: For whatſoever is undertaken for Religion ſake, as an honor unto God, beſide the command of God, is plain Idolatry; therefore altogether unlawful.</p>
                     <p>Again, All religious diſtinction of place is taken away, once Chriſt is come. The <hi>Veil of the Temple</hi> is rent in the midſt: Worſhip God in holineſs, and 'tis now no matter where we worſhip God. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> prayed and praiſed God at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in the priſon,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> Pray every where; for every where where thou prayeſt, God is preſent by his grace; He is over thee, he is under thee, he is before thee, and behind thee, he is on every ſide of thee. We cannot ſay now as once <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely God is in this place, and I knew it not;</hi> but, Surely God is in this place, and every place, and I know it; and I know that therefore I muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in this and every place. He that thinks otherwiſe, is <hi>procul à Jove,</hi> far from God. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be in the midſt of them,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; <hi>In medio virtus,</hi> The power of the moſt High will ſtand in the centre of them, that are gathered in his name, be where it will. God will not contend for place; Bring him a good heart any where, and it's all he requires at our hands. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe unlawful in the End; becauſe going to the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or other places ordained for the like Superſtition by Antichriſt, they think to merit the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But I am aſſured they are never the neerer it, by going thither, or any other the like place. Theſe Vagabonds (for ſo I may term them that run from place to place in that manner) ſteal from Chriſt, to adde to Superſtition. Life eternal is in the hands of Chriſt, and therefore his gift: And they going another way to foot out their ſalvation, foot it the wrong way; for Chriſt is the onely way;
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.6.</note> 
                        <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, It is unlawful, becauſe it is done to the Reliques and Images of dead men. They think to live by the dead; they ſhall have but a dead life on't. Thus while they go to do homage unto the dead, they rob the living God of his honor by the way; For they expect a remiſſion of their ſins, by the interceſſion and merits of thoſe dead, whoſe Reliques or Images they trudge ſo to adore. And whereas they run to the cuſtom of the Church, it is very falſe; the true Church of God never uſed it: For, Pilgrimage undertaken to the Reliques of the Dead, was not uſed in the Primitive Church, until three hundred years after Chriſt; and that unto Images, ſix hundred years, only by ſome; but both condemned for dead ſervices.</p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52564:227"/>
                     <p> Laſtly, It is unlawful, becauſe it is profitable neither to body or ſoul; neither of them that wander thus with aking heels, nor others; it tends no way to Chriſtian edification, there is no goodneſs in it: Therefore ſuch fruitleſs trees are to be rooted out of Gods growing Temple. And thus much for the falſe doctrine of Papiſts grounded on theſe words, (but falſly, but idly,) <hi>I went up to Hieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their other doctrine is, That <hi>Peter</hi> had the Supremacie of <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe the Text ſaith, he went to ſee <hi>Peter.</hi> Here we may obſerve the abſurd dealing of the Adverſary; who to patch up their ragged coat of Popery, do fain <hi>quidlibet ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet;</hi> as if to be viſited, doth argue a Primacie. And here the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> (as one calls them) [Gagling Geeſe] make a diſtinction of Viſitation: He went not up, ſay they, to ſee him in a vulgar manner; but for reſpect and honor of his perſon, and of duty; and (as <hi>Chryſostom</hi> noteth the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to import) to behold him as men behold a thing or perſon of name, excellency or majeſty.
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> Theſe are their very words. Indeed, that he came of honor and reverence to him, may be eaſily granted; but every reverence argues not a ſuperiority; for, reverence (ſaving their reverences) may be done to equals.</p>
                     <p>They ſay again, he did it as his duty; but there is no ſuch matter: This can be as ſoon denied, as affirmed. He came about his office and authority in preaching: For he was equal in honor unto him, ſaith a Father; and again ſaith the ſame,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> That bleſſed man went not to learn any thing of him, nor to receive any correction; but only to ſee him, and honour him with his preſence. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> he went to ſee <hi>Peter,</hi> for affection of Apoſtleſhip; that <hi>Peter</hi> might know that the ſame licence was given unto him, that he himſelf had received; and hence he is called his Fellow-Apoſtle, and had a Fellowſhip in the Colledge of the Apoſtles, as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for that place ſo often quoted by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock, &amp;c.</hi> It proves not a ſuperiority in another above the reſt of the Apoſtles: For, as one ſaith of that place; All the Logicians in the world cannot conclude in lawful Syllogiſm out of the words of that Chapter, That any greater authority was granted to <hi>Peter,</hi> than to every one of the Apoſtles. A primacie of order and promptneſs of faith cannot be denied him: but none of dignity. And here the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> again play upon the name <hi>Peter,</hi> ſignifying a Rock; a Stone; hence they make him to be the Foundation of the Church, and therefore the Principal Apoſtle. If they mean his Perſon, they are far deceived: If his Confeſſion, <hi>(Thou art Chriſt the Son of the everliving God)</hi> we agree. Hence ſaith one on theſe words, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church;</hi> calling a Rock, as I think, (ſaith he) the unmoveable Faith of the Diſciple. Again, If they ſay that he is the whole Foundation; away with that blaſphemy; they take away <hi>Chriſt</hi> the onely Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for ſtedfaſtneſs; (I ſay, for ſtedfaſtneſs; for this Foundation, <hi>Peter,</hi> did ſhake fearfully when he denied Chriſt; and he had been ground to powder, and fifted as wheat, had not Chriſt prayed for him:) and make the reſt ſtand for cyphers.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles are pillars of the Church; and what dignity hath one pillar in a Church more than another? Not onely <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were called pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Church; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. And when <hi>James, Cephas</hi> (that is <hi>Peter</hi>) and <hi>John,</hi> who ſeemed to be pillars. Again, the twelve are called twelve foundations.
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.14.</note> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the wall of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb. Hence ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> all the Apoſtles were ſtones: So might Papiſts ſay, were they not ſtones? Thus we ſee that <hi>Peter</hi> had not a Monarchical preheminence of honour above the Apoſtles. Therefore not above <hi>Paul;</hi> albeit he was his ſenior Apoſtle: Both of them are called <hi>Eodem titulo, fundatores Chriſtiani nominis,</hi> founders of the Chriſtian name; <hi>Peter</hi> among the <hi>Jews, Paul</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And one preſumes to call <hi>Paul maximum</hi> or <hi>ſummum Apoſtolum,</hi> the greateſt or higheſt Apoſtle. The reaſon may be this, becauſe he had more revelations than all of them. And here the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> becauſe they would not have their foundation pul'd down upon ſuch terms, grow to that malapertneſs, that they affirm; that the greateſt ſoveraignty in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52564:228"/>Gods Church,
<note place="margin">Revel. 3.7.</note> attributed unto Chriſt, is given to <hi>Peter,</hi> in theſe words, I have <hi>the key of David, that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth: Whatſoever ye bind in earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye looſe in earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> It in truth, is ſuch blaſphemy (as a godly man of our Church ſaith) as <hi>Peter</hi> would have rent his clothes, if he had heard any man attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo much unto him. For Chriſt hath <hi>the key of David,</hi> as the onely true <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, which openeth and no man ſhutteth, ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> This Key can no man have, except he were a <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Beſides, the words are in the Plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>whatſoever ye bind, whatſoever ye looſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus you have the true doctrine concerning theſe two falſe doctrines to my poor ability; wherein you ſee not onely the abſurdity of the doctrines, but alſo the abſurd grounding of them on theſe words; <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem to ſee Peter.</hi> I would not be curious, becauſe ſaith the Philoſopher, <hi>Accurate refellere ſtultas ſententias, ſtultum eſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſerves firſt to teach us not to build our faith on a ſtaggering foundation, ſuch as man is; Chriſt was faine to pray to God that <hi>Peters</hi> faith fail him not. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> than that which is laid, which is Jeſus Christ.</hi> To it let us cleave, and not cleave it.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, whereas <hi>Peter</hi> is called a rock, and the Apoſtles rocks, as they have the true rock in them, Chriſt Jeſus; It teacheth us to put no difference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of authority between them, but to give equal reſpect unto all of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all of us are rocks as long as we make this confeſſion; <hi>Thou art the Son of the ever living God.</hi>

                     <p>This conference argues alſo a mutual conſent. That both of them were of the ſame mind and agreement.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Eſau</hi> was coming into the world, <hi>Jacob</hi> had him faſt by the heel: <hi>Rebecca</hi> received blows within her by their ſtruglings; which, that acted, ended. But here ended not their ſtrife; that preſaged, as a future ſupplanting, ſo a more inveterate quarrel. <hi>Eſau</hi> was firſt born, ſo he obtained the birthright of nature; <hi>Jacob</hi> came after, yet got the birthright of grace. The mother was glad to be well rid of both: ſhe was much joyed to ſee them ſet at liberty, who incloſed in the priſon of her bowels pain'd her. As theſe agreed not in the womb, ſo not in the world: There the diviſion began, when together in reſtraint; here it continued, and by their enlargement was enlarged. The divine Oracle told <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that <hi>the elder ſhould ſerve the younger:</hi> 'twas his love to the one, his hate to the other, both free. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction muſt have been accompliſh'd, but not without ſome difficulty. Firſt, <hi>Jacob</hi> upon an advantage buyes the Birthright, which <hi>Eſau</hi> in a neceſſity ſcornfully deem'd unprofitable. Grace made <hi>Jacob</hi> lay about to purchaſe, what Nature denied him: It was inevitable; the God of Nature determin'd it that way, not the other. Thus <hi>Jacob,</hi> though a plain man, got the ſtart of <hi>Eſau,</hi> though a cunning hunter. A gracious ſimplicity ever outſtrips worldly craft in the affairs of piety. Now having got thus far, there wanted nothing to make good his bargain, to confirm his intereſt, but his Fathers bleſſing; which he by his Mothers direction hunting after, obtained by ſubtilty; whilſt <hi>Eſau</hi> hunting after veniſon, came ſhort of through his pleaſure. The Mother (ſaith Reverend <hi>Hall</hi>) ſhall rather defeat the Son, and beguile the Father, than the Father ſhall beguile the choſen Son of his bleſſing. <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt have been bleſt; God decreed it, and was. Who no ſooner went away full of the joy of his new bleſſing, but in comes <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſweating for his reward, finds nothing but an unexpected repulſe. Hereat <hi>Eſau's</hi> blood is up, and ſtorms; he hates <hi>Jacob</hi> in his heart, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel;</hi> in his hate vows his death, nothing hinders it but lack of opportunity. Yet <hi>Jacob</hi> needed not to fear the wrath of an earthly brother, whilſt ſure of the love of his Heavenly Father. None needs to be terrified by Man, that is in league with God. However it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved the Mother to be as ſollicitous in preventing miſchief from falling on her beloved Darling, as in ſurreptitiouſly procuring him a bleſſing. Had he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, all her hopes had periſh'd. <hi>Jacob</hi> therefore muſt go one way or other; if he ſtay till his Father die, he muſt die with him, and go the way of all fleſh: 'twas <hi>Eſau's</hi> reſolution. If he go whither his Parents would, he is ſecure; this way (as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52564:229"/>well it might) is preferr'd. To this purpoſe a new project is ſet on foot; <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt have a wife, not of the daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> as <hi>Eſau;</hi> theſe made <hi>Rebecca</hi> weary of her life; but of his own kindred. <hi>Iſaac</hi> forthwith calls <hi>Jacob</hi> to him, bleſſeth him, gives him a charge, and commands him away to <hi>Laban</hi> his mothers brother, where the Lord did deſtine him a mate meet for him. Away he hyes, doubtful and comfortleſs; in the way the earth he made his bed, the ſtone his pillow; after this fort he reſted his wearied limbs: The ſun was ſet, his eyes were bound up in the chains of ſleep; yet there a Viſion of Angels is preſented to him, through the glaſs of his imagination, and Gods promiſe renewed in a true dream. Never was <hi>Jacob's</hi> heart ſo light with joy, as when his head was heavieſt with ſleep. At length he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, his thoughts are ſummon'd up together, fear creeps apace on him; the place ſeems dreadful; the preſence of Divine Majeſty, whereof he was ſenſible, adds luſtre to the place, which adds affrightment to his heart. The premiſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, his concluſion of the Place is this; <hi>This is none other but the houſe of God; and this is the gate of heaven.</hi> Hitherto have I followed <hi>Jacob</hi> in his way; and with him here will I reſt a while.</p>
                     <p>This holy Patriarch, upon mature deliberation, could not but conceive himſelf happy, that he hapned on this holy place. Here the demonſtration of Gods joyful preſence with him, and gracious providence over him, together with the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſafe conduct to him, abated the ſwoln diſcontents of his ſuſpitious thoughts; it never came into his head he ſhould have here that familiar manifeſtation of the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as was vouchſafed him. But Gods goodneſs ever was, ever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mans expectation. How eaſie were it for <hi>Jacob</hi> to miſcarry in his way, did not the Supreme Power protect him? how open did he lie to infinite dangers, lying in the open field, did not the Lord ſecure him? 'Twas the work of that ſame Mercy that guided him to that place, to preſerve him ſafe there: where although he was afraid at the firſt ſight, after his ſleep was over;
<note place="margin">Muſculus, Buxtorf. Heb. Radix.</note> yet was his fear without diſtraction The clearneſs of his judgment diſcerning Gods intention in that myſtical viſion, ſentenceth the place venerable. So <hi>Muſculus</hi> renders the Hebrew text, <hi>Quàm venerandus est iſte locus!</hi> and <hi>Buxtorf, How reverend is this place!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I might treat, 1. Of <hi>Jacob's</hi> Fear. 2. Of the Dreadfulneſs or reverence of the place, where he was partaker of the Heavenly viſion. 3. Of the Titles <hi>Jacob</hi> aſſign'd the place. All meriting points; but the firſt is only intended.</p>
                     <p>The Soul which by nature is disfurniſhed of grace, is expoſed to dangers, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to evil; by reaſon whereof it is ſubject to fears within, to fears without. Perils like a circle compaſs us about; we ſtand <hi>tanquam in centro,</hi> as in the centre of this world; every line drawn from the circumference, ſtrikes us to the heart, and ſo affrights us. Turn which way we will, terror meets us, fears encounter us. Hereat the naked ſoul appal'd, yields; unleſs informed of a better friend than our own wits, which always are not about us. But Gods gracious preſence apprehended in our deepeſt agonies of fear, brings us off undaunted; by the light of whoſe grace we diſcover things in their native colours, which whilſt unknown, amaze us, diſturb us. Some things trouble us more than they ought to do, ſome which not at all; for the anticipating or avoiding whereof, that rule holds infallibly true, <hi>Rebus eſt demenda perſona,</hi> pull off the maſque of things, then we ſhall not ſo fear them. To be quite rid of this paſſion while we live, is impoſſible: Chriſtianity or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration qualifieth its force, takes it not away; Some impreſſion will be left in the mind, yet not ſo deep as will make us deſpair of ſuccour. For all the variety of Creatures, Caſualties, Changes that appear dreadful, there is variety of Aid, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from One unchangeable God; on whom if we reſt contented, not overruled with prejudicate opinions, never ſhall fear diſtract us. <hi>Plura ſunt quae nos terrent,

But it is otherwiſe with the well-inform'd Chriſtian, who ponders all events and examineth the cauſes; the defect whereof ſets ſome at their wits end. 'Tis ignorance and raſhneſs that makes way for miſpriſion, and miſpriſion for fear. The beſt things ſometimes ſcare us: Gods merciful goodneſs, not underſtood, puts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52564:230"/>us to a ſtand; his very favourable preſence, which ſhould move joy, did and ſhall move fear in ſome. I do not think there lives that man this day on earth ſo reſolute; did God appear, not in flaming fire, in thundering and lightening to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; but in a ſoft wind as to <hi>Elijah,</hi> or as here another way to <hi>Jacob,</hi> in every reſpect full of reſpect, but would be ſore afraid. Devout <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe dream por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing but happineſs, at the end of his Divine rapture was afraid. What he ſaw and fear'd, was no other but a welcom prediction of his future glory and perpetual ſafety; and yet was afraid. That magnificent greatneſs and bleſſed emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, to which the Lord promiſed to advance him, left him not undaunted. Yet this muſt I needs ſay, he was more afraid than hurt. 'Tis a certain truth, though God terrifie his children, yet he harms them not: No diſadvantage is taken to undo them by it, but to raiſe their ſpiritual fortunes. After the fall of their courage one way, at the brightneſs of his Majeſty; he puts ſpirit into them another way, to further their exaltation, thorugh a ſenſe of his mercy. Thus he doth with this religious man, whoſe fear gave the occaſion of my writing.</p>
                     <p>Here men may admire, ſo good a man would be taken napping, and then fear, when he had moſt reaſon to rejoice. The Father of Heaven did from Heaven look upon him with a benigne aſpect, yet he trembles. Obſerve what enſues, and ceaſe to wonder.</p>
                     <p>Religious hearts are in a continual awe of God, yet not bereft of comfort. 'Tis their bleſſedneſs,
<note place="margin">Pro. 28.14.</note> that they always fear; <hi>Happy is the man that feareth always:</hi> So it is to be referr'd, the well ordering of our converſation aright. Piety puts all things ſtraight in us, that rectifies all the paſſions of the ſoul, directeth our hearts to the fear of the Lord, which brings in time a crown of rejoycing. Hence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of us upon our Allegiance to his Supremacie Royal, which ſhould we deny,

                     <p>This holy Pilgrim, as he was deckt with the ornaments of Grace, ſo was he clogg'd with the infirmities of Nature. As he was of a good heart, ſo withal (without diſgrace) of a timorous diſpoſition. His fear might well conſiſt with his goodneſs: It was not carnal or worldly, ariſing out of an afflicting diſtruſt of Gods providence; Nor yet humane, begotten by an exceſſive deſire to this fugitive life; Nor ſervile, as proceeding from ſelf-love, ſo from the threatned judgments of an angry God, for the violations of his pure ſanctions: This, with the reſt, is ſever'd from grace.

Heavenly conſiderations do ſo affect them and an actual ſenſe of Gods goodneſs doth ſo tranſport them; that the Serpent like inſinuation of the World, the Fleſh, the Devil, faſtens not on them, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning what diſple ſeth God. Sin is loathſom, as making them abominable to him; Piety delectable, as procuring favour from him: His love rightly conceived of them, and their expectation of higheſt preferment in the Heaven of heavens, makes them fear (leſt they ſhould loſe both) to offend him that dwelleth there. So zealous is their care, through a ſenſe of miſery; ſo affectionate their fear, through a ſenſe partly of mercy, and of juſtice partly; that they become <hi>Argot</hi> eyed to look about, leſt they be foully overtaken with the pollution of ſins running ſource, What through infirmities, which make them uncapable of perfection in this life they cannot accompliſh, they through this holy fear compaſs in deſire; which of God is graciouſly accepted, accepting the good will for the good deed.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52564:231"/>was in him at firſt imperfect and initial, by the mixture of theſe graces with it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired perfection in him and became filial.</p>

The more violent this affection is, upon the leaſt appearance of a ſucceeding croſs, the more perplexities it raiſeth, and worketh the ſoul into many rending and jealous cogitations. Info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that good men, becauſe ſomewhat inclin'd to evil, are afraid of miſſing their he avenly purpoſes wherewith they are deeply enamored; and when they have found God here beneath, whom above all they love, yet becauſe they are not free from provocations, they fear to be deprived of him.

                     <p>Weakneſs again, and inability to reſiſt and overcome what may hurt us, lays us open under ſundry fears. Infinite are the events, which becauſe not uſual, prove inductions unto error. And ſuch is the impotency of frail man, that through the conſciouſneſs of his natural defects, he is ſoon dejected. Let him have what his heart can wiſh on earth, yet is he heartily afraid he ſhall not keep it long. The thought of a greater Power than is in him, raiſeth ſuch a dusky cloud of doubts, that he is not ſo well pleaſed with the ſight of his preſent happineſs, as troubled with the expectation of a diſmal change. So variable are our earthly courſes, that as they afford us no ſure footing, ſo neither can they eſtabliſh unto us any permanent content. 'Twas the royal word of a wiſe King inſpired of God;

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 53.</note> When the underſtanding is infatuated with carnal delights, when the judgment faſcinated with ſinful pleaſure; what marvel though man become puſillanimous? This is the condition of tranſgreſſors; A glimpſe of danger is able to make them ſtagger like a drunken man; or like a Prodigie, put them to an amazed ſtand, with a <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi> The regenerate themſelves are ſubject to the ſame paſſion, though not in the like meaſure, nor the like manner: They commonly ſtand upon their keeping; into whoſe hearts fear enters not ſo ſuddenly; yet enters, but daunteth not, deads not; clear Reaſon and ſure Religion preſerve them from aſtoniſhment. Let Satans fiery darts of temptations flie in their face, they fear, but little, (fleſh and blood will a little tremble) but their hearts are not wounded. Hence therefore are they ſo ready to encounter them,
<note place="margin">Zanch.</note> becauſe confident of a glorious iſſue. Let the Chiefeſt good, <hi>God,</hi> appear to them in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed forms, and manifeſt his propitious preſence in an unwonted manner, they cannot but fear; ſo awful is his Majeſty, ſo weak their nature: But when once well acquainted with the ways and courſes of the moſt High, grace fortifieth their hearts, and maketh paſſages extraordinary proceeding from him, ſeem familiar, at leaſt to them not ſo full of dread as to others.</p>
                     <p>Briefly, to be more diſtinct, Love and weakneſs beget fear: The love of God, ſear initial, filial; the love of our ſelves, and weakneſs, fear natural; weakneſs and love of the world, fear carnal, humane, ſervile. So then, <hi>Jacob</hi> being ſtrong in love with God, which was the act of grace; weak in himſelf, which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his nature; was naturally initially, filially afraid.</p>
                     <p>Tender is the diſpoſition of men ſanctified; their affections, thoughts, actions, are for the moſt part carried in a conſtant motion, within the verge of a religious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52564:232"/>Providence. If peradventure things, though good, happen out of courſe beyond expectation, they ſuſpect their own indignity in a fear of offending.

<note place="margin">Calv. in loc.</note> This demeanour of this holy Father (as one ſaith) condemns him of raſhneſs; (if not, why ſhould he fear?) but extolleth the goodneſs of his gracious God, who was found of him, where he ſought him not. One renowned for learning, judg'd that <hi>Jacob</hi> hereby modeſtly intimates, more was got than in modeſty his hope durſt to aſpire to; which as I take it, was the judgment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Bernard:
<note place="margin">Bern. in dedic. Eccleſ.</note> Miratur Jacob, &amp; dignationis magnitudinem expaveſcit; Jacob</hi> admires, in his admiration is abaſht at the greatneſs of Gods loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Twas ſtrange to him, that the Supreme Majeſty would hold him in ſuch reputation, as ſo friendly to reveal himſelf to him, or to make ſuch large promiſes of grace, as he did; which his beſt endeavours could never compaſs to merit. I think, <hi>Jacob</hi> thought not the news to be too good to be true, God told him; but too great for a ſinful creature to receive from a ſpotleſs Creator. However, beſide the glory and largeneſs of the Promiſe, the rarity of the Apparition did put him into a religious extaſie, being unacquainted with the Lords deſigns, or with his manner of working.</p>
                     <p>But ſoft a while; Should not <hi>Jacob,</hi> (the Almighty thus freely opening his heart unto him) rather rejoyce, than be afraid?

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon iſſues this conſequence, that Chriſt being the head of every true member of the Church. He is alſo the head of the whole Church. Concerning which, theſe two points are to be handled;
<list>
                           <item>1. According to what nature.</item>
                           <item>2. In what reſpect <hi>Chriſt is the head of the Church.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the firſt point, Chriſt is the head of the Church according to both natures, both his divine and humane, both which are two ſprings, whence do flow ſeveral Obſervations. In that Chriſt as God is head, I Obſerve, 1. The perpetuity of the Church, the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. 2. That with all reverent reſpect, obedience is to be rendred by us to Chriſt in all things. 3. That albeit Chriſt be aſcended <hi>to his Father and our Father, to his God and our God,</hi> yet is not the Church left deſtitute of an head on earth; for heaven and earth is fil'd with the glorious Majeſty of his Deity, and the Church with the ſpecial preſence of his Spirit</p>
                     <p>In that Chriſt as man is head of the Church, I Obſerve, 1. That his affection to us is intimate, the ſence of our miſeries in him accute, and he moſt prompt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clind to help us in all extremities. 2. That we may ſolace our ſelves, wipe away all teares from our eyes, and baniſh all ſorrow from our hearts; for that nothing is left Satan to triumph for over us, being that Chriſt in our nature hath overcome Satan.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond point, In what reſpects Chriſt is the head of the Church; My meditations are grounded upon the relation which the head hath to the members, and this conſiſts,
<list>
                           <item>1. In a diſcrepancy and diſtinction from the members.</item>
                           <item>2. In a congruity or agreement with them.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The relation of a natural head to the members, doth conſiſt in a diſcrepancy; which is four-fold, 1. The natural head differs from the members, in regard of eminence and dignity; ſo Chriſt from the Church and every ſingle member thereof, for he is God over all bleſſed for ever. 2. In regard of perfection; ſo <hi>of Chriſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do we all receive.</hi> 3. Thirdly, in regard of Government; ſo Chriſt by his Spirit ruleth in the hearts of the faithful, and they are at his ſervice. 4. In regard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; ſo there are infuſed in the ſoules of the elect, the divine and heavenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace from Chriſt, through whom they are able to do all things.</p>
                     <p>It conſiſteth likewiſe in a congruity and agreement; which is three-fold, 1. The head hath a natural conformity with the members; ſo Chriſt as man with every one of the Church, we are of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. 2. The head and members do agree in ordination to the ſame end, conſpiring together for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole entire; So Chriſt is now in glory, and the Church preſſeth forward to that eternal bleſſedneſs, which in the day of perfect redemption, they ſhall with Chriſt be actual poſſeſſours of. 3. The head and the members do agree in contiguity; ſo there is a ſpiritual contiguity effected by the ſupernatural operation of Gods Spirit, betwixt Chriſt and his myſtical body, whereby they are made one; <hi>they that are joined unto Chriſt are one spirit:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> And hence thoſe ſupernal graces, whoſe original is God, are with the more facility more copiouſly diffuſed, and the life of grace with heavenly inſpirations, the more amply diſtributed to each part; the power of which diffuſive diſtribution, principally reſideth in Chriſt the head, from whom the prime act of all tranſcendent information doth proceed.</p>

                     <p> For further illuſtration of this firſt; <hi>Chriſt is the head of the Church.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. In all places.</item>

An uncontroulable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this ubiquity and ſpecial preſence of Chriſt in Spirit, is the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, which is not comprehended (as heretofore) within the narrow bounds of <hi>Jury;</hi> or the circumference of one Kingdom; but <hi>the uttermoſt parts of the earth are his poſſeſſion;</hi> his call hath been heard in all Lands and all Nations. The ſound of the Apoſtles Doctrine concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note> 
                        <hi>went into all the Kingdomes of the earth, and their words into the ends of the world. Vitra Garaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; Indos protulet imperium,</hi> all ſorts of people are in ſubjection to his dominion. This was intimated to <hi>Peter</hi> in a viſion (as is by ſome wittily obſerved) <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>Where he ſaw heaven opened, and a certain veſſel deſcending unto him, as it had been a great ſheet, knit at the four corners, wherein were all manner of four-footed beaſts of the earth, and wild beaſts, and creeping things, and fowles of the aire.</hi> The veſſel knit at the four corners, did denotate the univerſality of the Church, the four corners of the veſſel anſwering the four corners of the world, Eaſt, Weſt, North, &amp; South. The ſeveral kind of creatures in it, call'd by <hi>Peter</hi> unclean, but by God cleans'd, ſignifies the Church of God collected out of all Nations and conditions of men, <hi>purified with the blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his Spirit.</hi> Wherefore, pious was that concluſion which <hi>Peter</hi> hence deducted, <hi>that in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs, without reſpect of perſons, is accepted with him.</hi> We read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. <hi>that at the end of the world, Christ will ſend forth his Angels to gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other;</hi> which infallibly is a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant expreſſion of the diſperſion of Gods Church through all the quarters of the world. We may yet aſcend higher, Chriſt is not head on earth alone, but in heaven alſo, every ſainted and glorified man is a triumphant member of this body of Chriſt. Thus Chriſt is the <hi>head of the Church in all places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is alſo the <hi>head of the Church at all times.</hi> 1. Before the law; for then the Patriarchs our forefathers enjoyed the benefit of the ſame glorious promiſes made in Chriſt Jeſus; that we now do; only the circumſtance altered, they believing that Chriſt ſhould be incarnate, we that he was. 2. Under the Law; for all the ceremonies, ſervices and ſacrifices, at that time, had reference unto him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom they could do nothing. It were through Chriſt they were vigorous, and for his ſake acceptable to God; and the perſons for whom the ſacrifices were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were not reſpected ſo much for thoſe ſacrifices, as for the Principal intended by them, Chriſt Jeſus. So that his Spirit was in the faithful then, elevating their ſouls to more ſublime objects, than there preſented to the outward view; and guiding their actions to an higher end, than there appearing. 3. He is the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Head after the Law, under the Goſpel. For by the Goſpel, <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> and by his holy Spirit <hi>leading us into all truth,</hi> and filling us with all eminent graces and Celeſtial benedictions; he governeth the Church Gods flock, conducting them to that Kingdom, which for them <hi>he hath purchaſed with his precious blood.</hi> And having ſince his manifeſtation in the fleſh, confer'd upon his people a more ample proportion of gifts: the aſſurance of theſe dayes in Chriſt, and happy communion with him, is more apparent than ever before. <hi>By him we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52564:235"/>have acceſſe unto the throne of grace; by him we are made partakers of the divine nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In brief, he is the head of the Church, by an unrevokable conſtitution from all eternity, and ſo unto eternity ſhall laſt. No Pontifical competitour can put him by it; no proud Prelate of <hi>Rome</hi> can partake of this honour proper to himſelf, and <hi>which he will not give unto another. Thus he is the head of the Church at all times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he is the Churches head in every ſtate and condition; whether we conſider his ſtate, or the ſtate of the Church. 1. If his; he was head in the ſtate of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, whileſt he was converſant among us here on earth; ſo is he now in his ſtate of exaltation unto glory, <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God the Father.</hi> 2. In the ſtate of the Church, let it be in what ſtate it may be, Chriſt is the head thereof, who will be with it <hi>even to the end of the world;</hi> in proſperity, in adverſity, in plenty, in poverty, in a waſtful perſecution, in a flouriſhing peace Chriſt ruleth it, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth it. And it being collected out of divers nations, ſects, vocations and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, Chriſt doth reſpect them all equally, not for any ſiniſter or worldly reſpect preferring one before another, but receiving all in the bowels of mercy into one myſtical body. For of a truth, he hath no reſpect of perſons; the outward or contingent conditions are not reflected upon, but into whom the ſupernatural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of the Spirit are infuſed, be they <hi>Lazaruſſes</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iveſſes,</hi> be they Kings or Beggars, be they <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is their head.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, Chriſt Jeſus is the head of the Church, in all authority. It is his own voice that ſaid, <hi>All power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth.</hi> Undepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſupremacy is proper unto him. Hence is he ſtiled by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation, the King of Saints,</hi> he exerciſing dominion over them; and they promiſing, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, performing all lawful obedience unto him. In the 2. of <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 10. he is termed <hi>the Captain of our ſalvation;</hi> which may have alluſion unto that, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.15. where he is called <hi>the Captain of the Lords hoſt:</hi> who, as he beats down our enemies before us, unweaponing them, and diſpoſſeſſing them of all forcible lability to lift up their heads againſt us; ſo doth he environ and ſurround us about with his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace and ever operative Providence, as that we do obtain a moſt ſecure convoy to the land of the living, <hi>which is the inheritance of the Saints in glory.</hi> Life and death are at his moſt juſt dipoſing, and none are exempted from awful ſubjection to his imperial Scepter. His authority reacheth over all, and the limits of his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extend as far as his alſufficient and unreſiſtible omnipotency. Thus Chriſt is head of the Church in all places, at all times, in all ſtates and conditions, and in all authority.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt, the reſpect of diſcrepancy; it is fourfold. The head differs from the members, in regard of eminency and dignity; ſo man from the woman: hence the government of the woman is committed to the man. Equity pleads for it; for from him ſhe firſt received her nature, her name, her honour. Her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe was framed out of the rib of man, and 'tis a Maxime in the art of reaſon, that <hi>Cauſa eſt potior effectu,</hi> the cauſe doth exceed the effect in excellence. Her name, <hi>ſhe ſhall be called woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Adam) for ſhe was taken out of man.</hi> Her honour, in that ſhe is one fleſh with man; <hi>they both ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> from which unity doth iſſue a communication of honour. <hi>For if one member be honoured, all the reſt rejoyce with it,</hi> faith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and good reaſon, for the honour given to any member or the head, is not ſo proper to it, but that it is participated to the reſt, cauſing an effluction of joy in all. So that what proportion of honour the woman is poſſeſſour of, it is derived from the principal in man, to whoſe ſuperintendency the woman by divine inſtitution is ſubject; <hi>for the man was not created for the woman,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.9.</note> but the woman for the man.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The head differs from the body in regard of perfection. There are more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute endowments, and perfections of greater excellency in the head, than in the other ſubordinate parts. None (I preſume) but a brainſick man will impugne this aſſertion; nor the conſequence of it, but a ſelf-will'd woman. Thus in man there is a confluence of more eminent qualities and rarer parts than are in the woman. The temper and conſtitution of his body is generally and naturally more ſolid, his ability in feates of activity more vigorous and ſubſtantial; wherefore the more apt for induſtrious labour. It is a Poſitive Principle in Ariſtotelical Philoſophy,

But let the naturaliſt yield me the like
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52564:236"/>liberty of my thoughts, as he for himſelf doth challenge to his own; There is no great glory purchaſed to man by the undervaluing of woman: queſtionleſs God having made woman as well as man, intending thereby mans good; nature, the ordinance of God,
<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> doth really intend the generation of woman. <hi>Aquinas</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the matter thus, <hi>That univerſal nature doth intend the production of woman, becauſe it looks to the main chance, the preſervation of the whole univerſe; but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<note place="margin">Durand.</note> but the contrary;</hi> which <hi>Durand</hi> another Schoolman denies, <hi>for the intention of particular nature is but ſubordinate, not oppoſite to that of univerſal nature, both aiming at tht ſame end.</hi> For mine own part (leſt I be cenſured to be unnatural to my Mother) I ſide with <hi>Durand</hi> for the woman; howſoever, the woman muſt yield to man that ſuperiority generally in bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whereof ſhe is not made capable.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, if you view mans ſoul, you ſhall find ſounder and more accurate intellectuals in him, than in woman, the vivacity both of his ſpeculative and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal underſtanding is far more exquiſite in compariſon. Thoſe inorganical operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mans ſpirit, and abſtract notions of his intellect, that have no dependances upon material or corporal ſubſtances, are more highly elevated, and have moſt commonly a more noble object, than woman can comprehend. His invention is more various, his judgment more fixt, and ſetled, than the invention, than the judgment generally of woman is; his reſolutions are leſſe ſubject to alteration, and his will follows the undeceiveable direction of right reaſon, more cloſe at the heeles, than hers doth. Thus in regard of perfection man is the head of the woman, who is term'd by the Apoſtle in this regard <hi>the weaker veſſel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The head differs from the body in reſpect of rule and authority: Every part of the body is guided by the head in voluntary actions. So is the man to govern his wife; <hi>he ſhall rule over thee</hi> (ſaith God) to the woman of the man: but neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her his ſlave, nor his ſervant, but his boſome friend and cloſe companion: and ſhe muſt be willing to ſubmit her neck to the yoke of obedience in all matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, leſt ſhe deſerve the infamous title of an <hi>unruly and diſordered wife.</hi> Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong fancies grounded but upon ſuperficial appearances, muſt not interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor attempt to draw another way; but at the appearing of ſufficient reaſons (which proceeding from the man, may be in a better interpretation term'd <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong</hi>) muſt vaniſh away. Hence let the judicious man learn to rule his wife, and the well-diſpoſed woman learn to obey her husbands will: that it may not be ſaid, what I oft heard men complaine of, <hi>that the wife is the husbands maſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The head differs from the body in regard of influence. From the head there is an influx of animal ſpirits into the parts of the body, whereby they are capable of fence and motion. So there is a power derived from the man to the woman, for the diſpatch of all domeſtick affairs and oeconomical employments, towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of life and well-being. Beſide, what powerful influence is derived unto her, for the inlarging of their houſe with an off-ſpring generated out of their own loines? And thus man is the head of the woman, in reſpect of that ſourfold diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy which is betwixt the head and the inferior parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the latter, <hi>Man is the head of the woman,</hi> in reſpect of congruity; which is threefold. The head hath a natural conformity with the members; both have the ſame nature. So man doth agree with woman in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> though he differ from her in <hi>ſexu. Adam</hi> ſaid of <hi>Eve, that he was fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone;</hi> and therefore (ſaith <hi>Moſes ſhall a man leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great myſtery</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) which is a reſemblance of a greater, <hi>the union of Chriſt and his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The head and members do agree in ordination to the ſame end, and joine their forces together for the attaining thereof. So the husband and wife do mutually concurre in bending their endeavours to the ſame ſcope. They are bound by a ſolemne promiſe and vow, to uphold the Chriſtian reputation and civil credit one of another. The end in this Matrimonial contract, where two are myſtically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into one, propounded and aimed at, is threefold; denoted in the form of Solemnization of Matrimony, 1. The procreation of children, to be educated in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52564:236"/>fear and nature of the Lord, and praiſe of God. 2. The avoidance of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſervation of chaſtity, thereby to keep themſelves undefiled members of Chriſts body; for in this ſacramental tye, there is comprehended a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction to curb in the inſolent and violent extravagancies of our carnal appetites and luſtful affections. 3. The mutual ſuccour and comfort that the one is to afford the other, both in proſperity and adverſity. <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man; <hi>there's no comfort in being alone;</hi> in which regard marriage is commended above a ſingle life.</p>
                     <p>Woman was made for an help to man, to eaſe him of part of his labours, of his pain; hence ſaith <hi>Solomon, A good wife is the gift of God;</hi> no earthly nor tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſing is like unto it: Sweet is the harmony betwixt the united couple, who admit no diſtractions; for then will they aime at another end, the ſupream, which will be acquired, Gods glory and their ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The head and the members agree in continuity. So man and wife ſingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out from all the world, and by an indiſſoluble conjunction until death, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Divine Ordinance of God, the firſt inſtituter of this Order, are made one: one in body, one in affection, by a loving conſent on both ſides,
<note place="margin">Epheſ 5.3.</note> 
                        <hi>They two ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>he that hateth his wife, hateth his own ſoul,</hi> which in nature is moſt monſtrous. No earthly unity is comparable to this. Where <hi>whom God doth thus joyn together, let none attempt to put aſunder;</hi> it was never the intention of the prime efficient of this ſacred Ordinance, that who were lawfully knit together, hand-faſted, and heart-faſted, ſhould be ever part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or really diſ-joyned; but ſhould continue one and the ſame unto their dying day.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.23.</note> 
                        <hi>Sic equidem ab initio,</hi> ſo (I am ſure) it was from the beginning. Thus the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the head of the wife, as Chriſt is the head of the Church. And thus much for the firſt point, in what reſpects the man is the head of the woman.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of my diſcourſe ſhall be concerning the Offices, mutually to be performed by man and wife.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with the wife; it is the Apoſtles exhortation unto them, <hi>Wives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.18. Epheſ. 5.24.</note> And in another place, <hi>as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo let wives be to their own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in every thing.</hi> This ſubmiſſion, this ſubjection doth import three things; 1. An internal act of the heart, conceiving and acknowledging their inferiority to their husbands, albeit for nobility of birth, and honourable deſcent, for riches, or vertue, or prudence, they may perhaps excel. Hence doth proceed as from its proper fountain outward ſubjection, which cannot be without the former, but either forced or feigned. This diſpoſition of the heart, diſcovered by outward expreſſions, the Apoſtles ſpeech ſeems to reflect upon; <hi>And the wife ſee that ſhe reverence her husband.</hi> For wives to be in ſubjection to their own husbands,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. laſt:</note> was the faſhion in the old world; thus <hi>Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.6.</note> Let it, O let it (ye that are the daughters of pious <hi>Sara</hi> as long as ye do well) be the faſhion now. So ſhall not the reſolute combination of your faithful hearts admit an interruption, nor your hearty harmony the leaſt jarring. 2. This ſubjection of wives imports an endeavour of conforming themſelves to their husbands humours, in all lawful and different matters. It is indeed a difficult task, but ſo much the more laudable when the work conſummated. An ingenuous nature will quickly effect it Hence, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>She that is married careth for the things of the world, how ſhe may pleaſe her husband.</hi> The principal way to attain preſent felicity, and undiſturb'd contentation in this life for a woman, is,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.34.</note> to be induſtrious in framing her diſpoſition and compoſing her affections in that manner, as that her actions may be correſpondent to her good mans deſires. When the rib whereof <hi>Eve</hi> was made, was taken out of <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> was in a deep ſleep, free from perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or pain; intimating (as one wittily obſerves) that women muſt be neither trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome nor painful unto their husbands, but ever good and pleaſing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This ſubjection hath this importance, that the love wives ought to bare their husbands, ought to be entire. The care of their eſtates and children, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; their bearing with their infirmities, patient; their application of comfort

Many, I think, have it lying by them, or in their hands; few indeed have it in their hearts. Many would have it if they did know how; this is the way, yet godly wiſdom, the practice will follow; and this is gotten by going to God:
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> 
                        <hi>God doth give the Spirit of wiſdom to ſuch as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire it; Ask, and it ſhall be given you. Solomons</hi> requeſt to God was for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and he gave it him, and more than that. None was than more wiſe then <hi>Solomon;</hi> the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came from the fartheſt bounds of the earth, to hear him diſcourſe. And none was then more wealthy, or in ſo great proſperity,
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.16. <hi>Bona throni,</hi> and <hi>bona ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe none more wiſe. <hi>The way then to prosper, is to obtain wiſdom of God. Length of dayes is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, I gather from hence: That Kings and Governours ſhould not diſpoſe the wiſdom which God beſtows on them, to their own private ends; but they muſt make others of the ſame rank, their ſons, their ſubjects partakers of it; as here <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did; <hi>ut Regis ad exemplum,</hi> that they might conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the like godly courſes. Which may be a counterblaſt to all thoſe baſtards of the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> that have ſnapped at the credit of ſome Princes; (witneſſe K. <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory) ſaying, that he was more fit to be a Divine, than a King. Blind leaders of the blind! why not both? (I mean not my profeſſion.) In that they are filled with ſo great a meaſure of divine knowledge above others; they are fitter to be Kings: <hi>David</hi> was a King and a Prophet, ſo was <hi>Solomon;</hi> why ſhould the like then be accounted a fault in others?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore; he that is the Principal Member of Gods Church, within his own dominions, ſhould be ſoundly grounded in Gods word, and able to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his faith. How were it poſſible <hi>that he and his houſe</hi> (with <hi>Joſhuah</hi>) <hi>ſhould ſerve the Lord truly,</hi> if he were ignorant of the points of Religion, or of thoſe things wherein he is to ſerve him? Kings muſt ſerve God as well as others; <hi>Reges ut reges,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin; Worſhip him all ye gods, Pſal.</hi> 97.7.
<note place="margin">Aug.</note> It was Gods own command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. where he ſetteth down what a King muſt do; <hi>And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a book, out of that which is before the Prieſts, the Levites: And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſtatutes to do them, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from this ariſeth another obſervation; That Kings and Governours ought to pray for divine Knowledge and Wiſdom. For in their Kingdoms they are Judges of Eccleſiaſtical and Civil matters, except they wilfully give up their titles of right. How can they judge righteouſly, if they be ignorant of the matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are Judges? They muſt ſcan matters over and over and ſift them; <hi>for it is the honour of Kings to ſearch out a matter. Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings,
<note place="margin">Prov. 25.2. Pſal. 2.10. Pſal. 119.104.</note> be inſtructed, ye Judges of the earth.</hi> But how is this gotten? <hi>Through thy precepts I get underſtanding,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I limit not my ſelf to Kings, but what I ſay of their duty, I ſay of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <hi>for they are Kings through Chriſt.</hi> The uſe then is this;

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52564:239"/>they may have wiſdom for the asking; or whereas, if by asking they obtain it, they ſhould uſe it to the edification of others; all is neglected: hence inſtead of pious ſongs, ſuch as <hi>Davids</hi> &amp; <hi>Solomons;</hi> the world is filled with ſwarms of Pamphlets. Let us therefore pray, <hi>that God would teach all of us ſo to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdome.</hi> And this for Preface to what enſues.</p>
                     <p>The words are ſhort and ſweet; being a breviary of the whole <hi>Pſalm;</hi> which is partly petitional, <hi>non voz ſed votum,</hi> from this firſt <hi>verſe</hi> to the eleventh; and partly repetitional, of Gods promiſes, <hi>non votum ſed vox,</hi> from the eleventh <hi>verſe</hi> to the end; all which is ſweetly compiled in theſe words, <hi>Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, as the firſt eſtabliſhing of Church and Policie, is in Gods power, ſo is it he that cauſeth a flouriſhing Church and Policie. As he gives the being, ſo alſo the welbeing. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it;</hi>

This is <hi>via regia,</hi> a Kings high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; <hi>Solomon</hi> hath chalk't it out. Here obſerve his voluntary allegiance to God. Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Kings ſons are to have a ſpecial care of the charge that their fathers leave behind with them; as <hi>Solomon</hi> had here of <hi>Davids.</hi> Therefore they muſt pray and do all that can be done, for the welfare of their ſubjects; ſo that they muſt not be ſlack in matters of Religion, but very zealous: it is that <hi>unicum neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. David</hi> hath lead him the way, the zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up, and <hi>Solomon</hi> was not far behind him, he follows the tract. And good reaſon. The Crown can never be kept without good ſubjects, the ſubjects can never be good without true Religion; <hi>Solomon</hi> prayes for both, and that is the next way to get both. And <hi>David, Peace be within thy walls,
<note place="margin">Pſal 122.</note> and proſperity within thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces;</hi> the effect of both. Both theſe, Care and Zeal, jump together in one peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, to root out Idolatry, and plant true Religion; What follows? Peace and Proſperity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, here is an Emblem of his hope joyn'd with innocency; this made him pray to the Lord with heart of grace. He knew the Articles; <hi>If thy children will keep my Covenant and my testimony, then their children ſhall ſit upon the throne for evermore.</hi> He found himſelf yet to have a good conſcience, for God will not hear the prayer of the wicked. Therefore his innocence confirmed his hope. Yet afterward he fell away, (whether wholly or no, we conclude not uncharitably of him with the Papiſts;) whereby the bond was forfeited,
<note place="margin">1 King. 11.</note> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe diſanull'd; and yet God was more merciful than he ſinful; for the Lord would not take all the Kingdom from <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor his ſeed for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake.
<note place="margin">Mat. 1.</note> Neither was <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed (being in captivity) quite cut off, for Chriſt deſcened from the line of <hi>David, according to the fleſh;</hi> and hence is called <hi>the Son of David,</hi> and now reigns for evermore according to Gods promiſe, and ſo is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord. This I touch by the way; It is requiſite then, that Kings ſhould have care to ſerve God continually, in the integrity and innocencie of their heart. If they fall from God, God falls from them; and then he will either rend their Kingdoms, as he did <hi>Solomons;</hi> or pull down both King and throne, and lay their honour in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>If not, but that they will keep Gods Commandments, and maintain Religion, as <hi>David</hi> did; as <hi>David</hi> ſhall they proſper all the dayes of their life. This <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> intended, and in this intent cried he, <hi>Lord, remember David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words again, do but obſerve <hi>Solomons Sampſon</hi>-like faith; he preſſeth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52564:240"/>God with his promiſe, his faith works upon that. Since God was ſo gracious to promiſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> would not ſtick to exact the thing promiſed: therefore whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God makes a promiſe either to King or people, they muſt not be ſo coy as not, to take hold of it, and to challenge God of his promiſe. For he promiſeth to the end they ſhould remember him; and thereby he them. Fear not then, it is his delight.</p>
                     <p>Again, Gods promiſe is the ſtrongeſt argument a man can uſe; it is a ſign of an invincible faith to apply it; the remembrance whereof ſhould drive us to God. And is the beſt comfort to a Chriſtian man in this life. It was here <hi>Solomons</hi> chiefeſt joy, which made him come thus to God; <hi>Lord, remember David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſhould ſeeme by this ſpeech, that God was aſleep, or forgetful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But the ſpeech is not proper; <hi>for he that keepeth Iſrael, doth neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor ſleep.</hi>

                     <p>Thus we ſee Gods love to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> zeal to Godward; he did as much as he could, more if he could do, he would have done; God denied, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would not reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>A doctrine for Kings and Governours, not to counter-check Gods commands. And when he heard he ſhould not do it, he ſate not idle, as many would have done; but prepared materials for the building.</p>

                     <p>There is a greater difference in the tranſlation of the word <hi>Gnuunotho; Auſtin, Hierom</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> with almoſt all the Papiſts tranſlate it, <hi>&amp; omnis manſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudinis ejus:</hi> but <hi>Luther, Calvin, Tremelius</hi> and others tranſlate it, <hi>Cum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ afflictione ejus.</hi> So <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> a Papiſt, <hi>Cum univerſa ejus afflictione; ad verbum cum omni affligi ejus;</hi> we follow the laſt.</p>
                     <p>But to leave off words, and come to the matter; it is manifeſt by theſe words, that <hi>David</hi> had many afflictions, yet he was the beloved of the Lord, his darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo was Chriſt, yet from the Cradle to the Croſſe was he afflicted; of whoſe troubles <hi>Davids</hi> here were types. Therefore Gods deareſt children are ſubject to afflictions; they are Gods meſſengers to bring them to him; meſſengers of life, not of death; of love, not of hate; for <hi>the Lord chaſteneth whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> was afflicted by <hi>Saul</hi> and his followers, before he had poſſeſſion of the throne; and after he was ſole Monarch placed in the throne, many were the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that attended on him. Thus Kings are not exempted from being afflicted.</p>
                     <p>Among his manifold troubles, this one is recounted, the inward care he had of finding out a ſit and convenient place where to build a Temple for the Lord. This we may perceive in the verſes following; he was toſt too and fro with many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, inwardly perplexed, and all for Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantine</hi> the great was of his mind, for no ſooner did he conquer <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> (by which victory he ended the Perſecution moved in the Eaſt and Weſt Churches) but he cauſed Biſhops to be conſecrated, Churches to be built, and then the Church of God began to flouriſh, which before was almoſt drown'd in the red ſea of bloody perſecution for ſome hundreds of years.</p>
                     <p>I might be infinite in reckoning up the Godly Acts in this kind, of Kings and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52564:241"/>Governours; which outward acts ſhew the inward love they bore to God and true Religion.</p>
                     <p>Here is mention made of <hi>Davids</hi> afflictions, to ſhew the truth or certainty of promiſe, as if they had been therewith ſeal'd and ſign'd. Which proves that he endur'd all theſe troubles, becauſe he had ſo fair promiſes of God. Therefore to whom God doth give comfortable promiſes, no trouble or anguiſh ſhould annoy him; but he ſhould willingly undergo all tribulations for the promiſe ſake. It was not for his afflictions that God made him this promiſe, it was gratis.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Davids</hi> afflictions are put down for an example, to incite others to ſuffer the like. To comfort them, and to aſſure them that albeit they ſuffer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many troubles, that it would ſeeme impoſſible that thoſe promiſes ſhould be accompliſhed, yet ſhould they put their truſt and hope in God, who out of ſtones is able to raiſe up children to <hi>Abraham.</hi>

From perſecuting the Goſpel, the Lord won him to the preaching of the Goſpel; from being a profeſt Enemy to Chriſtianity, to be a ſtrong Pillar of the Chriſtian Religion. The time was, that his whole aim was bent to the extirpation of the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus; not a Profeſſor durſt hold up his head in his ſight; his imployment was to find out ſuch, and to bring them bound to <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> To this purpoſe had he Letters framed, countenanced by the Great ones, and bacht with the chief Authority, that his actions might paſs unqueſtioned without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: Neither wanted he wit, learning and courage, to draw his projects into publique view and execution with all dexterity, thereby to diſcharge his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted Commiſſion with approbation.</p>

Becauſe they are called to the performance of that office, by Divine election and conſtitution, in theſe words, <hi>Over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods intent in calling them to that office, was <hi>to feed the Church of God.</hi> 4. Becauſe it is not a thing of a ſmall value, that is committed to their charge; but that which God with his own blood purchaſed; <hi>Which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I meddle with the two main particulars, (the onely matter intended) my meditation ſhall reflect a little upon the ground hereof, implied in the illative particle <hi>[therefore,]</hi> which ever hath relation to a precedent matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> protells that he hath <hi>declared the whole counſel of God to them;</hi> and that he is <hi>pure from the blood of all men,</hi> in that he did conceal nothing from them that concerned their ſalvation. Seeing then he leaves them in ſo good a ſtate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the Lords pleaſure and counſel; he chargeth the Elders to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of themſelves, and of the flock. <hi>Take heed therefore to your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where you may note, how piouſly <hi>Paul</hi> is devoted to Religion, how zealouſly affected to Gods Church, how provident for their welfare. Loth he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, until he had ſetled the affairs Eccleſiaſtical. A Synod therefore aſſembled, he lays himſelf open to all; Like an indulgent Parent departing from his children, could not part without an exhortation, for preventing future perils. He did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly conclude (as well he might) the improvidence of Miniſters ſhould be fatal to the Church. Neglective careleſneſs hath evermore a dead ſtroke in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or fall of Religion. Where pride pranked with outward ſemblances, goes for gravity; where outward obſervances and ceremonious complements, paſs for inward zeal and devotion; where humane eloquence (perhaps impertinent to the matter in hand) runs current for profound learning, and is preferr'd before the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit;</hi> where <hi>Hagar</hi> gets the preheminence of <hi>Sarah,</hi> (I mean) where Philoſophy ſhall coin Articles of Faith, and preſcribe rules to Divinity; where Vice walks in the habit of Vertue; where Avarice is counted Thriſtineſs; where gain of money and revenue is more deſired, than gain of ſouls: Gods Vineyard muſt needs be neglected, and without queſtion down comes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Take heed therefore to your ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle in this illation, hath yet a further reach. In the precedent verſe he doth aver, that he is <hi>pure from the blood of all men;</hi> and for his juſtification, alleageth that he hath <hi>kept back from them no part of Gods counſel,</hi> which he was pleaſed to reveal for their endleſs felicity. <hi>Take heed therefore to your ſelves, and to all the flock.</hi> Do ye ſo likewiſe. Hence it is requiſite that you be induſtrious in the ſearch of heavenly myſteries; See that Earth make you not to forget Heaven, and ſo ſlacken your care; but let your ſtudies be ſpent in finding knowledge, that is able to ſave your ſouls and them that hear you; in doctrine, in exhortation, in reproof, aiming at the perfection of the Saints of God, and his glory.</p>
                     <p>It is an unqueſtionable truth, That the blood of them who receive little or no inſtruction of their Paſtors; or who fall away from the Truth, through the Paſtors neglect or careleſs carriage in their vocation; will be required at the Paſtors hand. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his 33. <hi>chap.</hi> confirms this aſſertion: <hi>O ſon of man, I have ſet thee a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52564:242"/>watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael; therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth,

Attend to <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation; <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>take heed to your ſelves.</hi> The prime care of a faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, is how to behave himſelf in the Church of Chriſt, which is the <hi>houſe of the living God.</hi> It is an hard task, I muſt confeſs, he is put to a painful work that he takes in hand; for the finiſhing whereof, there muſt be a concurrence of conſcience and skill. If conſcience be without skill, the good will and honeſt intentions may win applauſe, <hi>egregiam certe laudem,</hi> but the Church is not profited: If skill, and no conſcience; whilſt <hi>he teacheth others, he himſelf becomes a reprobate.</hi> Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions he imparts to others, will in the end prove his own overthrow. <hi>Take heed therefore to your ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the ſpeech of <hi>Evagrius Scholaſticus,</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Libr.</hi> 3.</note> concerning an Emperor; That an Emperor is not to be counted of thereafter as he governeth others, but as he guideth and ruleth himſelf. It behoveth him to ſuffer no laſcivious motion to root within his breaſt, but valiantly to encounter with Intemperancie, and to make his life a pattern of vertue, or a lanthorn for his ſubjects to follow after, thereby to lead them to godly inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>This I may apply to the true <hi>Divine,</hi> and true <hi>Man of God:</hi> He muſt have an obſerving eye as well upon himſelf as others; All his actions muſt be ſo ruled, as that we may read piety in each of them, and that they may ſerve for patterns of imitation to the people. Surely, <hi>Nunquam aliorum ſalutem ſedulo curabit, qui ſuam negliget,</hi> ſaith one; It can never enter into my heart to think, much leſs to believe, that he ſhall be careful for the ſalvation of others, who ſhall neglect his own. It is an argument beyond probability, that that man will never reſpect any good, that ſlights his proper; except upon ſuch terms as <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed his <hi>name blotted out of the book of life,</hi> or as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf <hi>accurſed for his bretrhens ſake.</hi> But theſe were elevated to the higheſt pitch of zeal, which few ever attained unto: Theſe were ſtudious both of their own and others ſafety; and of others ſafety, <note place="margin">

Extraordinary circumſpection tranſporting us above the common ſphere, muſt be uſed, or elſe we ſhall be condemned of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary folly. <hi>The wiſe mans eyes are in his head,</hi> faith Wiſdom. It is a point of the greateſt wiſdom, for a man to have his wits ever about him; and far moſt of all for a Church-man. Subtile and powerful are they with whom he hath to do; the gifts where with he ought to be furniſhed withall, are not to be reputed vulgar; yet ſo are they to be tempered, as that they outſtretch not the capacity of the vulgar upon occaſion. His work is not ſtinted to the Body; the Soul is the ſubject he works upon. The dignity therefore of the Soul, far exceeds that of the Body. And as the commodity ariſing from their ſpiritual induſtry, redounds more to the Spirit of a man, the finer metal, than the Body, the baſer ſubſtance, though indeed to both: So in a <hi>Divine</hi> indeed, muſt the Divine habiliments of the mind, ſeaſoned and moderated with the grace of Gods holy Spirit; that they may work with the more agility, and with the greater efficacie, and far ſurpaſs the beſt endowments generally of the common ſort. He hath more precious things in hand than any; wherefore his ſufficiency muſt be correſpondent to his charge, and his care pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his ſufficiency. Salvation is the end of his intentions, and that that crowns his actions. Wherefore look about you, <hi>Tuke heed unto your ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In our ſelves, we muſt take heed of two things:
<list>
                           <item>1. Of our Doctrine.</item>
                           <item>2. Of our Life.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52564:243"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, and unto the doctrine, continue in them;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. uit.</note> for in doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi> As our life is not contemplative alone, ſpent in the bare ſpeculation of Divine oracles, like <hi>Moſes</hi> conferring with God; but alſo practical ſpent in actions with men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to holineſs: So we muſt behave our ſelves in both with that moderation and convenient warineſs, as that the one may be an help and furtherer to the other; to remove all obſtacles that may be prejudicial to the acquiring of the happineſs of Eternity, both in our ſelves and others.</p>
                     <p>The ornaments of the Prieſts robe in the old Law,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib. de ſacr. Altar. myſt. c.</hi> 17.</note> were ſignificant intimations hereof; as is obſerved by Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> It was ſumptuouſly garniſhed with Onix ſtones, Bells and Pomgranates: By the Onix ſtones are intimated Truth and Sincerity; by the brightneſs of their truth of Doctrine, which muſt be as clear as the Sun; by their ſolidity and integrity of Converſation, both ſpringing up out of ſound Learning: The Bells note our inceſſant ſounding forth the praiſes of the Lord in his holy Temple, by preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; <hi>Woe be to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, if I preach not the Gospel:</hi> The Pomgranates are ſigns, are ſymbols of good works.</p>
                     <p>The order gives occaſion of a further obſervation. There was a Bell and a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, a Bell and a Pomgranate, and a Bell betwixt every Pomgranate; figuring how that good works in the Miniſterial order, muſt be ever intermingled with good words; the matter of theſe yields matter for amplifying this diſcourſe. They were made of pure gold, pure metal abſtracted from all droſs; to ſignifie the neceſſary concurrence and ſweet harmony of an undefiled life, and true doctrine; both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing exceeding good to the eye, both ſounding exceeding well to the ear. If all of our Function excel in purity of life, and foundneſs of doctrine; then are we all (ſpiritually) true Bell-metal. Hence it is ſaid by the Evangeliſt, that <hi>Chriſt began to do and to teach;</hi> whoſe ſteps we muſt follow. He did much, but he <hi>did no ſin,</hi> to ſhew that our converſation ſhould be blameleſs; and <hi>in his mouth was found no guile,</hi> to ſhew that we ſhould ſpeak nothing but the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take heed of your Doctrine.</hi> Firſt, that it be found, agreeable to the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If any teach otherwiſe, let him be accurſed. The Word of God is the foundation of revealed Truth, whereupon we muſt build: Take heed of vain Philoſophy, whoſe precepts may ſeem ſpecious, but in them may be comprehended the <hi>doctrine of devils.</hi> Many turbulent ſpirits delighting to be pragmatical and factious, have obtruded into the Church <hi>for doctrine, the commandments of men;</hi> and for their own ends attempt to corrupt Religion, and bring in Innovations and new-fangled devices, cauſing an apoſtaſie from the Truth, and drawing diſciples after them. But (I truſt) ye have learned otherwiſe, not to be guided by the oſtentation or umbratical ſhews of any plauſible tongue, but by the moſt perfect rule of Divine truth, the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Believe it, Schiſmatical wits, if not prevented, breed an infection in the Church worſe than the plague. Let the Word of God then be the ground of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, leſt we wander out of the way, and affirmatively conclude what God denies. To this end, by Canonical conſtitutions they are to be duly examined, who plead for admittance into Holy Orders; that ſo they may both ſatisfie themſelves by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and certifie others, whether or no they be orthodoxally learned, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>apt to teach.</hi> Pious therefore was that reſolution of a moſt Reverend Father in God. Never to admit any into this holy Function, but ſuch, of whoſe Knowledge in Divinity he ſhould receive ſome competent intelligence. The part of a moſt wiſe and judicious Prelate. The admiſſion of illerate men into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, hath been the bane of our Religion, and the diſgrace of our Profeſſion, as we all well know. For where there is no Knowledge, the people muſt periſh, Gods ſervice and worſhip muſt be diſregarded. There are ſome are probably ſuſpected of heterodoxal doctrine; who upon examination, or ſerious diſpute, or preaching, care ſhould be taken they may be hindred from propagating their inventions. Others there are, whoſe Inſufficiency is ſo groſs, that to hear them ſpeak to the purpoſe, is as great a wonder, as it was to hear <hi>Balaam's</hi> Aſs. The Church ſuffereth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52564:243"/>under both. It is moſt convenient therefore, that whoſo deſire to take this Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, ſhould have ſolid Learning, and be able to exhort, to reprove, to inſtruct the people of God; and ſhould ſolemnly proteſt to teach and maintain nothing contrary to what the Word of God ſhall warrant. Let us therefore take heed unto our ſelves, that our Doctrine be ſound; for, <hi>The Prieſts lips preſerve knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, What we teach muſt be plain, as well as found. There is no goodneſs to be hoped, no proficiency to be expected by teaching, where, what is taught is not underſtood. Our ſpeech muſt not outſtretch the common apprehenſion:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prudentibus vicis non pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont phalerata, ſed fortia,</hi> ſaid Biſhop <hi>Iewel. Bonaventure's</hi> words in pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; were not <hi>inflantis, ſed inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia.</hi>
                        </note> Not ſtrong lines, but a plain phraſe tends to Edification, the end of Preaching. Many times, in difficult Terms lies enwrapt a peſtilent Hereſie. Hereticks (at leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſts) coin ſuch obſcure ſentences, as that they may walk unſeen, as it were in a cloud of obſcurity. But this is not the way to gain ſouls to God; the plaineſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the beſt. My ſpeech and my preaching (ſaith <hi>Paul) was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, What we teach we muſt preſs home to the Conſcience, as an arrow to the mark. It is not the pleaſing volubility of a ſuperficial tongue (olt-times exorbitant) that doth the work of the Lord, or makes a good Preacher, or found Chriſtian; it muſt be <hi>toucht with a coal from the Altar,</hi> that it may infuſe into the cold hearts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> men, the true zeal of perfect godlineſs. The Word of God well preſt, well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword,
<note place="margin">Heb 4.11.</note> piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> It ſwims not in the brain, as the Prophets axe did upon the water; but enters into the conſcience, and the very bowels (as I may ſo ſay) of the ſoul. What humane Eloquence hath ſuch effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual operation? Surely, it tickles the ear, but toucheth not the heart. Men may be never the wiſer, I am ſure never the better, where tickling words are preferr'd before ſolid matter; and where men endeavour to pleaſe the ear, more than to edifie the ſoul, or to comfort a diſtempered or diſtracted Conſcience, or to inform a miſled one.</p>
                     <p>God never condemns, but he firſt indicts and arraighs; He never puniſheth, but he firſt forewarns; He never rejects, but he firſt reſpects, He never ſends miſery, but he firſt offers mercy: He puts the <hi>way of life,</hi> and the <hi>way of death,</hi> before all, take which they will for better or worſe. Such is Gods good will to man, that ſeeing man cannot or will not come to him, he vouchſaſeth to come to man; ſuch is his goodneſs: either in his Divine perſon, as he did to <hi>Adam,</hi> or in his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; bidding them <hi>turn to him, that he might turn to them;</hi> that they might have experience of Gods mercy, (not of his judgments;) that <hi>He wills not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his wickedneſs and live.</hi> Herein he uſeth not the extremity of the Law againſt man; neither deals he as an unjuſt Judge, firſt hang; then examine the cauſe: But he opens the caſe, ſhews the cauſe, ſets their ſins in order before their eyes, and makes known the dangers they lie in, by a Proclamation; <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.1.</note> and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such therefore are only fit for Gods people, who can <hi>cry aloud, and ſpare not.</hi> Spare not,</p>

                     <p>Now of the <hi>Caveat</hi> briefly, as it reſpects the Church of God. <hi>Take heed to all the flock, &amp;c.</hi> A Miniſter hath the cuſtody of many ſouls; and if any periſh through his means, he is liable to Gods judgments. As therefore we come provided with Knowledge, ſo with a reſolution to propagate and diffuſe it. Knowledge in the beſt of us, not communicated to the building up of the Church in holineſs, is like coſtly materials prepared for the erecting of ſome ſumptuous building, yet to no uſe, the loſs whereof is irrecoverable. It ſtands us upon therefore to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; to be Inſtructers of the flock committed to our charge, both in doctrine and manner of living. The reaſon hereof rendred in my Text, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, in that we are made <hi>Overſeers of the flock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word interpreted <hi>Overſeer,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: hence, ſaith one, <hi>Nomen Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopi plus ſonat oneris quàm honoris.</hi> But I take it here in a larger ſignification than it is commonly uſed. All Miniſters are Overſeers of that Flock, the charge of whoſe ſouls is committed to them. They are their Spiritual Tutors, unfolding unto them the ſecret myſteries of Divine knowledge: They muſt inform them, if ignorant; reform them, if erroneous; reprove them, if diſſolute; confirm them, if weak in the faith.</p>
                     <p>They are called <hi>Watchmen,</hi> to watch for their ſouls ſalvation, that they be not <hi>carried away with every wind of dectrine,</hi> that they run not into abſurd enormities; but that they <hi>hold fast the profeſſion of the faith, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of their lives.</hi> They are called <hi>Paſtors,</hi> whoſe calling is to uſe all diligence to feed their flock, and protect them from eminent miſchiefs, by a careful foreſight,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52564:245"/>or preſent needful power. The Symbole of this (ſay ſome) is the Biſhops Croſier, the Spiritual Shepherds ſtaff, which is <hi>acutus in fine ad pungendum pigros, rectus in medio ad regendum debiles, retortus in ſummo ad colligendum vagos:</hi> ſharp in the end, to prick up the ſlothful and make them nimble; right in the midſt, to govern the weak; but crooked in the top like a hook, to gather the diſperſed, or ſuch as go aſtray. They are called <hi>Gods Stewards,</hi> whoſe office is, faithfully to provide all things neceſſary for his family. They are called the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to diſcover things hid in darkneſs; They by their knowledge diſpel the clouds of ignorance, by their holy converſation the works of darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>All things that are diſcovered, are made manifeſt by the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light: hence they <hi>ſhew the houſe of Judah their ſins,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5 13.</note> and the houſe of Jacob their thrnſgreſſions.</hi> They are called <hi>Stars,</hi> Fixt in the right hand of God, <hi>tanquam in firmamento ſuo,</hi> as in their heaven. Stars have their light from the Sun; ſo you not originally from your ſelves, but derivatively from the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs:</hi> Your knowledge proceeds from the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, who was in the boſom of the Father, and muſt be communicated to the world. And to this end they move perpetually about the world; ſo ought you about the Church, that all therein may be partakers of the <hi>light of life.</hi>

                     <p>Wonderful are the effects, and powerful the operation that the Celeſtial bodies have by their influences upon the Elements, and upon thoſe things compacted by them: So queſtionleſs, the effects wrought by the powerful preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is the <hi>power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> by ſuch whoſe converſation is in heaven, as Divine ſtars, are far ſuperior unto them. The operation, I am ſure, more effectual, becauſe more ſpiritual. For as the Stars beget life in things void of life, and cauſe vegetation by their heat; So they by their precepts beget ſaith, in thoſe that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; which is the ſoul of the ſoul, by which we live unto God; for, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> and <hi>the juſt lives by his faith.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, by the propagation of the Goſpel by preaching, the Church of God grows, and all therein as tender plants and trees of righteouſneſs, bring forth the fruits of eternal life.

                     <p>And becauſe the way is aſcendant, leading gradually upward; I therefore may compare it to a pair of ſtaires, or call it <hi>Scalam Jacobi,</hi> St <hi>James his ladder;</hi> wherein are to be obſerved,

                     <p>As for the bottome, it is that good word of God, the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which the Holy Ghoſt by this Sainted Penman, is pleaſed to ſtile a law; deſcrib'd by two ſingular attributes, the one of perfection, the other of liberty, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect law of liberty.</p>

Becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes puniſhments to the diſobedient tranſgreſſors thereof; ſincere obedience and eſſectual beleeving in Chriſt being exacted of us, upon pain of death. 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Of this twofold liberty, there are theſe parts, 1. A liberty from ſin; our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Goſpel, and faithful embracing of the promiſes of God in Chriſt; frees us both from the raigning power of ſin; and from the condemning power: For <hi>being made free from ſin, we become ſervants to God, and have our fruit unto holineſs, and the and everluſting life, Rom.</hi> 6.22. 2. A liberty from the yoke of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, and bondage of the morall. From the yoke of the ceremonial law, which was ſo ponderous, as <hi>that neither we nor our fathers were able to bear:</hi> but now by Chriſt and the law of faith, it is blotted out, quite aboliſhed, and taken out of the way.</p>
                     <p>And from the bondage of the moral law in theſe enſuing particulars; 1. From the curſe, and conſequently from the puniſhment of ſin, the tranſgreſſion of the law; <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us:</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> and the Apoſtle certifies us, that <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 2. From the rigour and exaction of the law, requiring of us for our juſtification, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs inherent in us, and perfect obedience to be practiſ'd by us. 3. From the terrour and coaction of the law, which ingendereth ſervile fear in thoſe who are under it, and compelleth them through the horror of torment, as bond-ſlaves by the whip or rack, to the outward (though unwilling) performance of it. But thoſe that are under the law of grace, are zealouſly addicted to good works and ſervices of God; which are over done by them, with the free conſent of a plous mind; the original cauſe whereof is not any natural diſpoſition; but <hi>the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us.</hi> 4. from the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52564:247"/>inſtigation of the law, for which reaſon ſaith <hi>Pareus</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. it hath got the name of the ſtrength of ſin, <hi>whereby ſin appears more ſinfull;</hi> which is not cauſed by any fault in the law, in it ſelf good, and condemning ſin; but through the viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our unregenerate nature, that takes occaſion from the ſacred prohibitions of it, to tranſgreſſe: which irritation is accidentall, not eſſentiall to the undefiled law of the righteous Lord.</p>
                     <p>Another part of this liberty, is a liberty from death; which is twofold, the firſt and the ſecond. They that are effectually in ſubjection to the Goſpel, the glad-tidings of peace; are free from the firſt death, as it is a puniſhment: And from the ſecond, <hi>over them the ſecond death ſhall have no power.</hi>

                     <p>Laſt of all there is a liberty from Sathan and the world, granted to the ſons of God, adopted in the Son of God, the Son of God hath over come the ſtrong man, <note place="margin">Not <hi>imperium Principis,</hi> but <hi>Carnificis. à Lapide.</hi>
                        </note> and bound him, as being ſtronger than he; <hi>thorough death, he destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; and delivereth them who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage, Heb.</hi> 2.14. Get thee behind us Satan (as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi>) and let the wicked world follow thee, which Chriſt hath over-come. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> And ſince (O loving Saviour) we live free men, free from ſin reigning, condemning, free from Satan and the world, under the eaſy yoke of thy Evangelical Law, and under the protection of thy wings; We will, with thy diſciples, <hi>follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt;</hi> and run after thee, whither thy good Spirit ſhall lead us. Thus it is apparent, how the Goſpel of Chriſt is <hi>a perfect Law of liberty; into which whoſo looketh and continueth therein, he being not a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the work, ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi>

                     <p>From the bottome of the ſtairs or ladder, we now go up the ſteps: the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſpeculation, <hi>whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty.</hi>

                        </gap>, ſignifying an exact and accurate prying into a thing; as if one to find out, ſomewhat difficult to find out, ſhould ſtand in this poſture, with his body or head bended towards the earth, his eyes contracted and fixed upon ſome object, as if he did intend to look it through, and ſo to inform himſelf fully: Thus when we attempt to look into the abſtruſe myſteries of divinity, to acquaint our ſelves with the ſacred Principles of Religion; a ſuperficial view is of no avail; Profound matters require a ſerious and frequent meditation, an indefatigable ſtudy; hence the Apoſtle St <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribing the deſire of the Angels to know the hidden myſteries of ſalvation, expreſſeth it by the ſame word, the Angels deſire to look narrowly into the things revealed to us by the Holy Ghoſt, a work worthy their and our pains: not to be poſted over with a careleſs run, but to be ſtuck cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and proſecuted until finiſhed, and the mind in ſome ſort reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>Had that Apoſtate <hi>Julian</hi> disburdened his ſoul of all praejudicate opinions, had he pondered divine truths as was requiſite, had he look't into it as into the word of God; he never had blaſphemed it, in ſaying, <hi>Vidi, legi, contempſi;</hi> I ſaw it, read it, contemned it; to whom learned <hi>Baſil</hi> modeſtly replied as <hi>Chamier</hi> that famous French-man reports out of hiſtory, <hi>Vidiſti? legiſti? non intellexiſti, ſi intellexiſſes, non contempſiſſes;</hi> ſawedſt thou it? readſt thou it? thou never underſtoodſt it; hadſt thou underſtood it, thou hadſt never contemn'd it. Of ſo great authority and ſo full of divine majeſty are the Oracles of God; as that in an underſtanding man, they beget an awful reverence, and mightily prevail for an obedient ſubſcription, with thoſe that ſtudiouſly look into it: never man ſpake as Chriſt, never man as God.</p>
                     <p>Now who thoſe are that ſhould diligently enquire after the will of God, and look
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52564:248"/>into the perfect Law of liberty; is a point worthy our enquiring after. None but ſuch as exempt themſelves from God, exempt themſelves from this task. All are bound to it, but who will obſerve it? Miniſter and People, as they combine to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, ſo to know him, <hi>and whom he hath ſent Jeſus Christ:</hi> The Knowledge of whoſe will glides not into the ſoul of man, by natural inſtinct, or moral infuſion; but by the Spirit and the Word of truth; the Spirit illuminating, the Word inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our underſtanding, In which word, we that are Paſtours of the flock of Chriſt, above others muſt uſe aſſiduous ſcrutiny: 'tis our profeſſion to know more than ordinary, <note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> as appointed in an higher ſphear to be Overſeers of the Church of God. Hence the Spirit terms the Prophets Seers, becauſe they ſaw the will of God, which others alſo ſaw by them; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> and the Apoſtles with their ſucceſſours, ſtewards of the myſteries of God, and Embaſſadors for Chriſt, to pray men in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God: <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>En flexanimam ſuadae medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</hi>
                        </note> whoſe knowledge by preaching muſt be diffuſed, others muſt reap the benefit of our paines. God makes us knowing men, to make knowing men; which many have taken on them to do, but ſome neglect it; ſome can, but will not; ſome will not, becauſe they cannot; ſome cannot, and yet preſume: As for them that can and will not, I pity them, <hi>they ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes;</hi> as for them that will not, becauſe they cannot, I ſlight them, though richer than my ſelfe, <hi>they are but dumb dogs;</hi> as for them that cannot, yet preſume; the world may jeere them, they make the Pulpit undervalued. But for Gods ſake my brethren let us that can, will; and endeavor when we ſpeak from the father of languages, to deliver our embaſſage, not in an ill one, leſt we expoſe our ſelves to a ſcornful cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; nor in a too obſcure and affected one, labouring more for fine words than fit ones; leſt affecting the praiſe of humane eloquence; we feed the people as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> did his Paraſites, with painted diſhes; as thoſe fed the eye, not the body, ſo the other tickle the eare, but profit not the ſoul. 'Tis truth that one ſpeakes, there is a Magick in the tongue, can charm the wild mans motions: and though <hi>God hath choſen by weak things to confound the wiſe;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27.</note> yet experience ſhews, that in all times a waſhed language hath much prevailed. The Scriptures are pen'd in a tongue of a deep expreſſion, in every word almoſt a Metaphor illuſtrating by ſome alluſion. How political is <hi>Moſes?</hi> how Philoſophycal and Mathematical is <hi>Job?</hi> how maſſy and ſententious <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs?</hi> how quaint and amorouſly affected in his <hi>Canticles?</hi> how grave and ſolemn in his <hi>Eccleſiastes?</hi> and how poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and full of heavenly raptures, is his father in his <hi>Pſalmes?</hi> Chriſts doctrine aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Jewes; Paul</hi> pleaded at the barr in a tranſcendent ſtraine of eloquence, and in diſpute was ſubtile. In a word, it ſuites not with the Majeſty of ſo divine an Art as is that of winning ſoules, to be preſented in ſordid rags, but in a graceful trimme, yet plain. Confections that are cordial, are not the worſe, but the better, for being guilded. Divinity, as it muſt not laſciviate, ſo being well ordered by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant words, placed in a native decency; angles the ſoul, and lifts it up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Herod</hi> therefore bade the wiſe men, <hi>diligently to ſearch for the young child Jeſus, and when they had found him, to bring him word; that he might go and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him alſo,</hi> ſo I adviſe my brethren accurately to look into this perfect law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and when they have found what there is hidden, by conſtant preaching to divulge it.

This tends to verifying <hi>Winifrids</hi> Apothegme, changing one word; In old time there were golden Paſtors and wooden Chalices, but now gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Chalices and wooden Paſtors: as of old the <hi>Jewes</hi> had a royal Temple, but a raſcal Prieſthood.

                     <p>The Romans held their Cenſors ſo reverend, that they thought him worthy of no ſmall puniſhment that did but yawne before him; and ſhall not God judge them (think you) that care not how they hear his Embaſſadors, <hi>holding forth the word of reconciliation?</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Attila,</hi> that received <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> as the Lord himſelf; and the fooliſh Galatians, that received Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt hiraſelf; ſhall riſe and condemn all perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Auditors of his truth.

                        <note place="margin">Prov. 13.13.</note> Carefully look then into the Word by hearing, ſo ſhall ye ſuredly paſſe that danger.</p>
                     <p>Again, your practice muſt be to read the Law of your God; whileſt your tongues read, your ſouls hear God ſpeaking: The circumſpect reading of one Chapter whereof (I ſpeak it by experience) ſets me a thinking more than I can imagine; it elevates the ſoul above it ſelf, which reſts ſatisfied without expecting farther Enthuſiaſms or new Revelations; ſuch heavenly doctrine is thereby dropt into the heart, as fits the reader to render a reaſon of his faith. Thoſe faithful witneſſes of Chriſt in <hi>Bohemia</hi> called <hi>Thalorites,</hi> if they had not diligently plyed the Scriptures, could not have been ſo skilful in them, as <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> their profeſt enemy reporteth them. <note place="margin">

Nothing can carry us ſo near God and heaven as this; do but joyn them together, and they give up a man to raptures, and irradiate the ſoul with ſuch high apprehenſions; that all that wiſdom which this world hath, hereby appears contemptible.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better underſtanding of the mind of God, it will not be amiſſe in reading, in meditating; to confer Scripture with Scripture: As the clouds claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the aire above, throw them at the length a moſt bright lightning; ſo do the Scriptures when parallel'd.

                     <p>Furthermore, your practice muſt be to confer with the learned dead, with the learned living; ſo Chriſts diſciples did with Chriſt, the Eunuch did ſo with <hi>Philip. Hierom</hi> highly commends <hi>Marcella</hi> for the like, and <hi>Fiabiola</hi> for the like zeal. With the learned dead, in their works; breathing inſtructions are more effectual (all grant) but theſe have their operation: And being the number is but ſmall, as the number of Pearls in compariſon of baſer ſtones; the want (bleſſed be our God) is well provided for, by their living monuments; which we may uſe, as a traveller doth a Map, the better to find out the way; or as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did the mans help, that adviſed him to leave <hi>Sechem,</hi> and ſeek his brethren in <hi>Dothan.</hi>

Whereupon our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them by the name of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> to <hi>painted ſepulchres;</hi> and others give them the plauſible appellation of <hi>white Devils.</hi> Painted ſepulchres are glorious without, but within nothing viſible but rottenneſs: White Devils appear like Angels of light; but do but ſearch them, and you ſhall find them Angels of darkneſs; Devils, though white as the Devil would have it, and as the Negro's paint him, as a colour contrary to their own, <hi>Multa videntur quae non ſunt;</hi> Many good things appear by them, but not one good thing can be found in them. Our Saviour deciphered them by the name of <hi>Wolves in Sheeps clothing;</hi> harmleſs in profeſſion, but in truth of a wolviſh diſpoſition; like thoſe in the <hi>Revelasion,</hi> that <hi>ſaid they were Jews, and were not, but the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Theſe are Saints in the Devils name, and of his making, whoſe damnation is juſt, and from whom good Lord deliver us.

Of this our Saviour ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelf, that they alſo may be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> And the Apoſtle delivers this doctrine thus; That <hi>Chriſt loved his Church, and he gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie it, and preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinckle,</hi> or any ſuch thing, <hi>but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Were it not that they are not imputed, and that Chriſts righteouſneſs is imputed to them; many were the ſpots and wrinkles of the Saints whilſt here militant. Sanctity imports, among other things, a cleanſing from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity: whence <hi>Iſidore, Sancti, quaſi ſanguine tincti;</hi> Saints are ſo called, becauſe they are ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> Who were antiently purified, were ſprinkled with the blood of the Sacrifice; ſo now the Saints with the blood of the Son of God, <hi>who gave himſelf for them to God, an Offering and a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour;</hi> the righteouſneſs and merits of which Sacrifice are made theirs by aſſignment. <hi>Aſſignata eſt homini aliena juſtitia, quia caruit ſuâ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> ſaith <hi>Bernard;</hi> The righteouſneſs of another is allotted and aſſigned unto man, becauſe he loſt his own conferr'd on him of God. Since mans firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and fall from God, none could ever be perfect Saints in this world, without the perfect rightcouſneſs of Chriſt, which perfects them alone to whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52564:251"/>who being in Chriſt Jeſus, are conſidered as one myſtical perſon with him who is their Head, from whom floweth all perfection, by whom remiſſion of ſin is compaſſed, and through whom freedom from condemnation eternally is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Thus Gods Saints are Saints by Imputation; whom I believe in Chriſt to be no ſinners, and therefore not guilty of death, but juſt and holy, and lords over both ſin and death, and aſſured heirs of everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>The Saints of God are Saints by Renovation: For to whom God ſent forth his Son into the world to redeem them, God ſends forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts to ſanctifie them; which Sanctity wrought by the Spirit of grace and Word of God, is a quality or qualification newly created in their hearts, whereby the Image of God which was loſt by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is again reſtored, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſin by degrees aboliſhed; the working grace of the bleſſed Spirit never ceaſing, until by a tranſcendent operation it mould and frame them to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs. Hence they are called <hi>new creatures,</hi> whoſe intentions and actions are conformed to the exact rule of hólineſs, Gods moſt holy Word, and the unerring directions of his renewing Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Saints thus by Renovation, have in them a twofold grace and righteouſneſs, <hi>Viz.</hi>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The inherent grace or righteouſneſs of the Saints, doth not originally ariſe out of the principles of Nature, but of Gods free grace; not of their own induſtrious acquiſition, but of Gods favorable infuſion. Hereby the tyranny of ſin was and is ſuppreſſed in them, and the violence of their natural corruption inclined to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, by the predominancy of a more effectual grace habituated in them, kept in order and ſubjection. Hereby the ruines of our nature are repaired, and we by the quickning power of the God of life therein, graciouſly revived. Hereby all Gods Saints are diſpoſed and enabled to perform his injunctions; and <hi>made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the Beloved;</hi> without whom, inherent grace or ſanctity is neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent nor operative: for in Chriſt, and by Chriſt alone, the Saints are what they are, and do what good they do.</p>
                     <p>The actual righteouſneſs of the Saints of God, is that conformity, which their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceeding from the habit of grace, wrought in them by the Spirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dwelling in their hearts, have to Gods law. This is moral; yet the beginning, the progreſſion, and the finiſhing of it, proceeds from the Supreme Author of all good. <hi>Nulli ſunt conatus noſtri ad bonum, ſi non excitentur; vani, ſi non adjuventur:</hi> We never bend our endeavours and forces to the performance of any good thing, if not excited: and all are but vain, if not ſupported. For who is ſufficient for theſe things that God exacts, if God enable not? His grace is ſufficient for us, and without it we inſufficient for them. The Saints <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> but by the help of God, <hi>that worketh in them both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> By the efficacy of his al ſufficient working they exerciſe themſelves unto godlineſs, and apply their hearts to his ſervice. Hence they are called <hi>Veſſels of honour,</hi> and <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſequeſtred from all others for the ſervice of the Lord, and honour of his holy Name. It is to honour and to ſerve him, that the Saints are by Baptiſm admitted into the Church;
<note place="margin">Nazianzen.</note> whence <hi>Nazianzen</hi> deſcribes Baptiſm to be, <hi>Pactum vitae purioris cum Deo,</hi> A compact made by man with God, to lead an undefiled life, and not to walk in the way of ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Sanctity I conceive to be like a Diametrical line in a Circle, conſtituting two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Hemiſpheres of men, differencing the good from the bad, the Saints from the Wicked: whereby we, and all men who are the Saints of God now in being, are advertiſed to eſchew the ſociety of Atheiſts, Blaſphemers, Drunkards, Adulterers, Idolaters, and all malefactors, and to tread in the pure footſteps of the bleſſed Saints, in their heavenly hemiſphere; compoſing our ſelves to keep within the Compaſs into which no Devil can have admittance. We are men (if Saints) of another and a

Set theſe three before you for example, and ye ſhall be ſupplanters of ſin; and able to trip up the devils heeles, and prevall with God for a bleſſing; ye ſhall be ſtones, like <hi>Davids</hi> pebble ſlung at <hi>Goliath,</hi> able to daſh Satan, that he ſhall not have a word to ſpeak againſt you, or power to hurt you; you ſhall be the <hi>gracious children of the moſt high;</hi> in a word, <hi>ye ſhall be,</hi> as they were, <hi>Pillars in the Temple of God.</hi> And thus I come to the deſcription of theſe three Apoſtles, <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John, who ſeemed to be pillars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was Chriſt's queſtion, <hi>whereunto ſhall we liken the Kingdom of God,
<note place="margin">Mark. 4.</note> or with what compariſon ſhall we compare it?</hi> According unto which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> frame another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhall we liken the Apoſtles of Chriſt, or with what compariſon ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them? I omit many, that of Shepheards, that of Overſeers, or that of faithfull Stewards in Gods houſe, and ſuch like; onely I inſiſt on this in the text; <hi>Pillars; who ſeemed to be Pillars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles then, whom I may rightly terme,
<note place="margin">Gen. 32.2.</note> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did the Angels that met him, <hi>Gods hoast;</hi> are like unto <hi>pillars</hi> in this firſt; <hi>viz. Pillars</hi> are not the foundation, but laid on the foundation. Here then obſerve, that neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor any of the Apoſtles, nor altogether, can be truly called <hi>fundamentum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Dei,</hi> the foundation of Gods Church; it is Chriſt's own prerogative royal, to be the foundation, the head of his people;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.2.</note> hence ſaith the Anointed of the God of <hi>Jacob, the Lord is my rock, my fortreſſe, and my deliverer;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 22.1 Cor. 3.11:</note> for who is God ſave the Lord, and who is a rock ſave our God? Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Christ;</hi> ſo that we need not go to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeek a foundation, <hi>for we are built upon the foundation</hi> (that is the doctrine) <hi>of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf being the chief corner-stone,</hi>

As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>like a wiſe maſter-builder</hi> I have laid the foundation, ſo might the reſt of the Apoſtles ſay; and thus in number twelve, indeed but one.</p>

                     <p>The Pillars of the Tabernacle were upright, ſo as alſo the Pillars of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple.

                     <p>From my former ſpeech, I deduce this conſequence; we may make theſe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars our pillows, as <hi>Jacob</hi> made the ſtone his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. where we may lie down ſecure, ſleep quietly without diſturbance, reſt comfortably without annoyance.

                     <p>Now let us make this uſe, that we maintain and not budge from the doctrine of the Apoſtles. <hi>Take heed,</hi> faith the Lord,

                     <p>I cannot paſſe over theſe Pillars yet, yet I will not ſtay long on them. We read that the Lord went before the <hi>Iſraelites, in a pillar of cloud by day;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 13.21.</note> So doth he now this bleſſed day, this Sunſhine of the Goſpel go before us in a cloud of Witneſſes, Prophets, Patriarchs, Apoſtles; <hi>we are compaſſed about with a great cloud of witneſſes,</hi> Heb. 12.1. We read alſo the Lord went before them in a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of fire; he goes before us in the Apoſtles, as in Pillars of fire that give light unto us, in this night of ſin, this vale of miſery, this ſhadow of death. <hi>John Baptist was a burning lamp,</hi> and the Apoſtles were <hi>the light of the world</hi> faith Chriſt; <hi>Suâ fide, ſua doctrinà, ſuis operibus, luminaria facts ſunt;</hi> By their faith, by their doctrine, by their works, they were made ſtars.

Grace is given of God by grace; A bleſſed Giver, a bleſſed gift, The earth of our hearts brings not forth ſuch branches of vertue; but as the earth after Gods curſe upon it, thorns and thiſtles. I will not here encounter with Papiſts concerning Free-will in both kinds of Gods graces; but leave it to ſome other <hi>David,</hi> who can better cut off <hi>Goliah's</hi> head, as with the ſword of the Spirit, as with his own ſword, and beat them with their own weapons.

                     <p>And here note the wiſdom of God: <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> full of wiſdom, was ſent here unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who ſought for wiſdom: <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> excellent for working miracles, ſent unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſought always for miracles and ſigns, a ſign of their infidelity; all working togeher for the good of his elect, of one mind when fartheſt aſunder.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> have rejected the yoke of Chriſt, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (of whom we are a part) have taken it on them: We may ſay of them, as they ſometime of us, <hi>We have a little ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts. Amazon</hi>-like ſhe hath one breaſt, the Old Teſtament; but wants the other, the chief breaſt, the New. Let us pray for them, as they did for us; that they may hear Chriſt crying out aloud to the Church,
<note place="margin">Cant. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Return, return, O Shulamite, return, return!</hi> that we may look upon thee, and ſee as it were the company of two Armies, the one of <hi>Jews,</hi> the other of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all one Church, one flock.</p>

                     <p> 
                        <hi>We pray thee then, O Heavenly Father, to call the uncalled</hi> Jew <hi>and</hi> Gentile, <hi>to comfort the comfortleſs, and to make an end of theſe dayes of ſin wherein we live; and cauſe our Saviour to appear in the clouds, for our full and perfect Redemption. Do it for his ſake, that died for us: To whom, with Thee and thy Holy Spirit, be given all glory; As it was in the beginning, ſo now and ever ſhall be, world without end.</hi> Amen.</p>
